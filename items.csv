Bryn Terfel,Achievement,"It was in Cardiff, and the cast was 60 per cent Welsh-speaking.

Bertrand Russell,Achievement,"Unless one is taught what to do with success after getting it, achievement of it must inevitably leave him prey to boredom."
Benjamin Graham,Achievement,"Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up forever; when a company has already registered a brilliant expansion, its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement more difficult."
Woodrow Wilson,Achievement,"You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand."

Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs."

James Fenimore Cooper,Ambition,"The common faults of American language are an ambition of effect, a want of simplicity, and a turgid abuse of terms."
Friedrich Nietzsche,Ambition,"The desire to create continually is vulgar and betrays jealousy, envy, ambition. If one is something one really does not need to make anything - and one nonetheless does very much. There exists above the ''productive'' man a yet higher species."
Anna Garlin Spencer,Ambition,The failure of women to produce genius of the first rank in most of the supreme forms of human effort has been used to block the way of all women of talent and ambition for intellectual achievement.
John Keats,Ambition,"The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness."
William Hazlitt,Ambition,"The incentive to ambition is the love of power.,
,
"
Barney Frank,Ambition,"The left and the right live in parallel universes. The right listens to talk radio, the left's on the Internet and they just reinforce one another. They have no sense of reality. I have now one ambition: to retire before it becomes essential to tweet."
Alva Myrdal,Ambition,"The longing for peace is rooted in the hearts of all men. But the striving, which at present has become so insistent, cannot lay claim to such an ambition as leading the way to eternal peace, or solving all disputes among nations."
William Hazlitt,Ambition,"The love of fame is almost another name for the love of excellence; or it is the ambition to attain the highest excellence, sanctioned by the highest authority, that of time."
Bill Dedman,Ambition,"The main threads running through the lives of W. A. Clark and his daughter Huguette include the costs of ambition, the burdens of inherited wealth, the fragility of reputation, the folly of judging someone's life from the outside, and the tension between engaging with the world, with all its risks, and keeping a safe distance from danger."
Herbert N. Casson,Ambition,The men who succeed are the efficient few. They are the few who have the ambition and will power to develop themselves.
Gerald Early,Ambition,"The Miss America contest is the most perfectly rendered theater in our culture, for it so perfectly captures what we yearn for: a low-class ritual, a polished restatement of vulgarity, that wants to open the door to high-class respectability by way of plain middle-class anxiety and ambition."
Derek Jarman,Ambition,"The preserve of ambition and folly in pursuit of illusion, or delusion."
Alexander Pope,Ambition,"The same ambition can destroy or save, and make a patriot as it makes a knave.,

William M. Thackeray,Ambition,To endure is greater than to dare; to tire out hostile fortune; to be daunted by no difficulty; to keep heart when all have lost it; to go through intrigue spotless; to forego even ambition when the end is gained - who can say this is not greatness?
Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,Ambition,To make converts is the natural ambition of everyone.
Billie Burke,Ambition,"To survive there, you need the ambition of a Latin-American revolutionary, the ego of a grand opera tenor, and the physical stamina of a cow pony."
William James,Ambition,"We have grown literally afraid to be poor. We despise anyone who elects to be poor in order to simplify and save his inner life. If he does not join the general scramble and pant with the money-making street, we deem him spiritless and lacking in ambition."
Bjorn Ulvaeus,Ambition,"We will never appear on stage again. There is simply no motivation to re-group. Money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were. Young, exuburent, full of energy and ambition."
Francois de la Rochefoucauld,Ambition,"What seems to be generosity is often no more than disguised ambition, which overlooks a small interest in order to secure a great one."

Thomas Merton,Ambition,"When ambition ends, happiness begins.,
"
Billy Idol,Ambition,"When I started out, everyone seemed to be adopting these names... Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious. I wasn't really Rotten or Vicious or Nasty, so I wanted something a bit more funny - yet something that seemed real rock 'n' roll... something that acknowledged my ambition."
David Hume,Ambition,"Where ambition can cover its enterprises, even to the person himself, under the appearance of principle, it is the most incurable and inflexible of passions."
Sir Henry Taylor,Ambition,Where there are large powers with little ambition... nature may be said to have fallen short of her purposes.
Aldous Huxley,Ambition,A belief in hell and the knowledge that every ambition is doomed to frustration at the hands of a skeleton have never prevented the majority of human beings from behaving as though death were no more than an unfounded rumor.

George Orwell,Animals,"All animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others. "
Jean Baudrillard,Animals,"If everything is perfect, language is useless. This is true for animals. If animals don't speak, it's because everything's perfect for them. If one day they start to speak, it will be because the world has lost a certain sort of perfection."
Ouida,Animals,"In a few generations more, there will probably be no room at all allowed for animals on the earth: no need of them, no toleration of them. An immense agony will have then ceased, but with it there will also have passed away the last smile of the world's youth."

George Eliot,Animals,"Animals are such agreeable friends, they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms."
Malcolm de Chazal,Animals,"Animals awaken, first facially, then bodily. Men's bodies wake before their faces do. The animal sleeps within its body, man sleeps with his body in his mind."

Joseph Addison,Animals,"Animals, in their generation, are wiser than the sons of men; but their wisdom is confined to a few particulars, and lies in a very narrow compass."

Elizabeth Janeway,Animals,"Growing up human is uniquely a matter of social relations rather than biology. What we learn from connections within the family takes the place of instincts that program the behavior of animals; which raises the question, how good are these connections?"
George Bernard Shaw,Animals,Human beings are the only animals of which I am thoroughly and cravenly afraid.
C. S. Lewis,Animals,"Humans are amphibians - half spirit and half animal. As spirits they belong to the eternal world, but as animals they inhabit time."
A. Whitney Brown,Animals,I am not a vegetarian because I love animals; I am a vegetarian because I hate plants.
Graham Swift,Animals,"I am struck by the way people behave on the Tube. They look at each other beadily and inquisitively, and something goes on in their thoughts which must be equivalent to the way dogs and other animals, when they meet, sniff each other's arses and nuzzle each other's fur."
George Bernard Shaw,Animals,I do not want to make my stomach a graveyard of dead animals.
Friedrich Nietzsche,Animals,"I fear animals regard man as a creature of their own kind which has in a highly dangerous fashion lost its healthy animal reason - as the mad animal, as the laughing animal, as the weeping animal, as the unhappy animal."
Henry David Thoreau,Animals,"I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized."

Buffy Sainte-Marie,Animals,"I've always had that attitude about my career: it's something that I do, but it's not my whole life. I have a real life, a personal life: I've got a lot of chickens, I've got a horse, I've got a kitty-cat, I've got a lot of goats, I've got animals all over the place."
Anne Tyler,Animals,"I've always thought a hotel ought to offer optional small animals. I mean a cat to sleep on your bed at night, or a dog of some kind to act pleased when you come in. You ever notice how a hotel room feels so lifeless?"

Gilbert K. Chesterton,Animals,"Man is an exception, whatever else he is. If he is not the image of God, then he is a disease of the dust. If it is not true that a divine being fell, then we can only say that one of the animals went entirely off its head."
Thomas Hobbes,Animals,"Man is distinguished, not only by his reason; but also by this singular passion from other animals... which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continual and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceeds the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure."
René Daumal,Animals,"Man is head, chest and stomach. Each of these animals operates, more often than not, individually. I eat, I feel, I even, although rarely, think. This jungle crawls and teems, is hungry, roars, gets angry, devours itself, and its cacophonic concert does not even stop when you are asleep."
George Bernard Shaw,Animals,Man's inhumanity to man is only surpassed by his cruelty to animals.
Ayn Rand,Animals,"Man's unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjusting themselves to their background, man survives by adjusting his background to himself."
Adam Smith,Animals,"Mankind are animals that makes bargains, no other animal does this."
Confucius,Animals,Mankind differs from the animals only by a little and most people throw that away.

Asa Gray,Animals,"Many years ago it was taught that plants and animals were composed of different materials: plants, of a chemical substance of three elements,- carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; animals of one of four elements, nitrogen being added to the other three."
Bryan Callen,Animals,"My point of view is that men are basically animals, and I'm okay with that."
Mary Wortley Montagu,Animals,"Nature has not placed us in an inferior rank to men, no more than the females of other animals, where we see no distinction of capacity, though I am persuaded if there was a commonwealth of rational horses... it would be an established maxim amongst them that a mare could not be taught to pace."
Honoré de Balzac,Animals,Nature makes only dumb animals. We owe the fools to society.
Thomas Love Peacock,Animals,Nothing can be more obvious than all animals were created solely and exclusively for the use of man.
Russell Hoban,Animals,Nothing to be done really about animals. Anything you do looks foolish. The answer isn't in us. It's almost as if we're put here on earth to show how silly they aren't.
Joseph Rudyard Kipling,Animals,"Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me why I had never told anyone how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established."
Byron Howard,Animals,"One of the magical things about these anthropomorphic animal movies is that we can take things that are so common in our own world that we deal with, like the DMV, or moving to a new city, or our family, and show you a mirror image of those things, reflected in a whole new way. That's why animals are great."
Bee Wilson,Animals,"One of the rudest things you can do, food-wise, is to stare at someone in the act of eating. It draws attention to the unseemly fact that eating is a bodily function - like animals, we are trapped by our hungers, but we do our best to disguise them with such civilized props as menus and forks."
Friedrich Nietzsche,Animals,Only the most acute and active animals are capable of boredom. A theme for a great poet would be God's boredom on the seventh day of creation.
Malcolm de Chazal,Animals,"Our expression and our words never coincide, which is why the animals don't understand us.''"
Ali ibn Abi Talib,Animals,People's hearts are like wild animals. They attach their selves to those that love and train them.
Bea Arthur,Animals,PETA has a proven track record of success. Each victory PETA wins for the animals is a stepping stone upon which we build a more compassionate world for all beings - and we will never give up our fight until all animals are treated with respect and kindness.
Samuel Butler,Animals,"Rare virtues are like rare plants or animals, things that have not been able to hold their own in the world. A virtue to be serviceable must, like gold, be alloyed with some commoner but more durable metal."
Jean Baudrillard,Animals,"Sadder than destitution, sadder than a beggar is the man who eats alone in public. Nothing more contradicts the laws of man or beast, for animals always do each other the honor of sharing or disputing each other's food."
Leonard Cohen,Animals,"Seven to eleven is a huge chunk of life, full of dulling and forgetting. It is fabled that we slowly lose the gift of speech with animals, that birds no longer visit our windowsills to converse. As our eyes grow accustomed to sight they armor themselves against wonder."
Camille Paglia,Animals,"Sexual freedom, sexual liberation. A modern delusion. We are hierarchical animals. Sweep one hierarchy away, and another will take its place, perhaps less palatable than the first."
Alice Walker,Animals,"The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men."
James Thurber,Animals,"The animals that depend on instinct have an inherent knowledge of the laws of economics and of how to apply them; Man, with his powers of reason, has reduced economics to the level of a farce which is at once funnier and more tragic than Tobacco Road."
Asa Gray,Animals,"The best opinion now is, that there are multitudinous forms which are not sufficiently differentiated to be distinctively either plant or animal, while, as respects ordinary plants and animals, the difficulty of laying down a definition has become far greater than ever before."

Carl Sagan,Animals,"The uniqueness of humans has been claimed on many grounds, but most often because of our tool-making, culture, language, reason and morality. We have them, the other animals don't, and - so the argument goes - that's that."
Henry Louis Mencken,Animals,"There is nothing worse than an idle hour, with no occupation offering. People who have many such hours are simply animals waiting docilely for death. We all come to that state soon or late. It is the curse of senility."
Benito Mussolini,Animals,This is the epitaph I want on my tomb: Here lies one of the most intelligent animals who ever appeared on the face of the Earth.
Edwin Way Teale,Animals,"Those who wish to pet and baby wild animals, ''love'' them. But those who respect their natures and wish to let them live normal lives, love them more."

George Bernard Shaw,Animals,We are all victims of the violence that animals suffer... their liberation is also our liberation.
John Steinbeck,Animals,"We are lonesome animals. We spend all our life trying to be less lonesome. One of our ancient methods is to tell a story begging the listener to say - and to feel - ''Yes, that's the way it is, or at least that's the way I feel it. You're not as alone as you thought.''"
Stephen Covey,Animals,"We are not animals. We are not a product of what has happened to us in our past. We have the power of choice.,

Brigitte Bardot,Animals,"We have abolished the death penalty for humans, so why should it continue for animals?"
Arnold Toynbee,Animals,"We have been God-like in our planned breeding of our domesticated plants and animals, but we have been rabbit-like in our unplanned breeding of ourselves."
Bruce Cameron,Animals,"We have enforced a Darwinian process on wolves, turning them into the shy and elusive animals they've become. They didn't have that fear of us 30,000 years ago. We didn't have gunpowder; we had rocks. Wolves would have seen us as lunch, and we were weak and slow and tasty."
Barbara Kingsolver,Animals,We're animals. We're born like every other mammal and we live our whole lives around disguised animal thoughts.
William Golding,Animals,What are we? Humans? Or animals? Or savages?
James A. Froude,Animals,Wild animals never kill for sport. Man is the only one to whom the torture and death of his fellow creatures is amusing in itself.
Bryan Fuller,Animals,"With land-roaming animals, I've just read so much about the sophistication of their emotional lives and their intelligence and the way they process information that betrays a greater intelligence."

Ann Bancroft,Appearance,"And then there's also this element of - some people would describe it as spirits or a presence that appears when things are very difficult, physically and emotionally. You know, when you're really putting out. So the third man aura is sort of an appearance. It's the yeti."
Friedrich von Schiller,Appearance,Appearance rules the world.

Andrew Vachss,Appearance,Building a mechanical device for its appearance is like putting lace on a bowling ball.

We're hard on each other because we're using each other as a launching pad out of our own perceived deficiency."
Andre Weil,Appearance,Intuition makes much of it; I mean by this the faculty of seeing a connection between things that in appearance are completely different; it does not fail to lead us astray quite often.

Bryan Batt,Body,"I do find, coming form the stage and all that, I've always been conscious of my posture and my body, but also the style aspect, I do find myself throwing on a blazer and a nice pair of loafers more often. Daddy always likes a new pair of Guccis."
Busy Philipps,Body,"I do think moms should be given a break, all across the board. And I think that the most important thing is that you're healthy.

Lord Chesterfield,Body,"I find, by experience, that the mind and the body are more than married, for they are most intimately united; and when one suffers, the other sympathizes."
Bronson Pinchot,Body,"I go to the gym a lot, and I see these guys, these young actors or models there, really punishing themselves - I mean, just killing themselves.

Elizabeth Taylor,Body,"I have a woman's body and a child's emotions.,
"
Busy Philipps,Body,"I like starting off the new year fresh. I'm excited to see how 2013 turns out. Maybe because I'm an actress and I am always on a diet and fitness program, but my New Year's resolution is to let myself be nice to myself about my body."

Brene Brown,Body,"If I feel good about my parenting, I have no interest in judging other people's choices.

Emily Dickinson,Body,"If I read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can ever warm me, I know that is poetry.,

B. R. Ambedkar,Body,"Law and order are the medicine of the body politic and when the body politic gets sick, medicine must be administered."
Carol Shields,Body,"Learning to skip has brought control into her life. Whenever she feels all sad, she switches into this wholly happy gait, sliding, hopping, and sliding again; when doing this, it seems as though her head separates from her body, making her feel dizzy and emptied out of bad thoughts. Does anyone else know this trick, she wonders? Probably not, although her Mother sometimes smiles and waves from the window."
St. Ignatius Loyola,Body,Let me look at the foulness and ugliness of my body. Let me see myself as an ulcerous sore running with every horrible and disgusting poison.

Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,Body,"Meditation is just a strategy to take away your personality, your thoughts, your mind, your identity with the body, and leave you absolutely alone inside, just a living fire.

Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,Body,"Meditation is the breath of your soul. Just as breathing is the life of the body, meditation is the life of the soul."

Honoré de Balzac,Body,Modesty is the conscience of the body.

Paracelsus,Body,"Once a disease has entered the body, all parts which are healthy must fight it: not one alone, but all. Because a disease might mean their common death. Nature knows this; and Nature attacks the disease with whatever help she can muster."
Bernie Siegel,Body,"One of the best ways to change is to act as if you are the person you want to become. When you behave as if you are a different person, you change on a very basic level - even your physiology changes.

Bill Nelson,Body,"One of the great privileges of being a part of the Senate, it being the greatest deliberative body in the world, is out of the discussions of ideas, hopefully truth can ultimately be achieved."

Bruce Jackson,Body,"Television broadcasts have, in the main, been more suggestive, less specific, more distant in their images than the print press: often you knew that lump was a dead body only because a chattering reporter told you it was."
Beth Ditto,Body,"Thanks to capitalism, the importance placed on beauty has never been so manipulated.

Caitlin Stasey,Body,"The 'ideal' body is everywhere you look, and we are made to feel like failures by advertisers and corporations who shame us into buying their products."

Camille Paglia,Body,"The female body is a chthonian machine, indifferent to the spirit who inhabits it."
Boris Pasternak,Body,"The great majority of us are required to live a life of constant duplicity. Your health is bound to be affected if, day after day, you say the opposite of what you feel, if you grovel before what you dislike, and rejoice at what brings you nothing but misfortune. Our nervous system isn't just a fiction, it's a part of our physical body, and our soul exists in space, and is inside us, like the teeth in our mouth. It can't be forever violated with impunity."
Doris Lessing,Body,"The great secret that all old people share is that you really haven't changed in seventy or eighty years. Your body changes, but you don't change at all. And that, of course, causes great confusion.,
"

Sir Peter Medawar,Body,The human mind treats a new idea the way the body treats a strange protein; it rejects it.
Bernie Siegel,Body,"The mind and body are not separate units, but one integrated system. How we act and what we think, eat, and feel are all related to our health. Physicians should be capable of teaching this behavior to patients."
Benjamin Robbins Curtis,Body,The mind as well as the body must be not only strong but well disciplined in order to act with promptness and vigor in new and untried situations. It is hard to turn men's minds from the old and deeply worn channels in which they have long been flowing.
David Herbert Lawrence,Body,"The mind can assert anything and pretend it has proved it. My beliefs I test on my body, on my intuitional consciousness, and when I get a response there, then I accept."
Ben Carson,Body,The mind controls so much of the body. We are much more than flesh and blood; we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they're going to do better.

Anita Roddick,Body,"The money that we make from the company goes into The Body Shop Foundation, which isn't one of those awful tax shelters like some in America. It just functions to take the money and give it away."
Fran Lebowitz,Body,"The most common error made in matters of appearance is the belief that one should disdain the superficial and let the true beauty of one's soul shine through. If there are places on your body where this is a possibility, you are not attractive - you are leaking."

Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,Body,"When the body sinks into death, the essence of man is revealed. Man is a knot, a web, a mesh into which relationships are tied. Only those relationships matter.

"
Butch Trucks,Body,"When we're playing, when we're really, really going... you're just in the moment. You're not thinking about yesterday, tomorrow, or anything else. The brain gets out of the way. Your body just does what it knows how to do, and it's just... it's like a religion."

Nicolai A.

Then the local churches design themselves to fit the desires of the people. True faith in God that demands selflessness is being replaced by trendy religion that serves the selfish."
Michel de Certeau,Churchs,Political organizations have slowly substituted themselves for the Churches as the places for believing practices. Politics has once again become religious.

Chief Seattle,Cities,"There is no quiet place in the white man's cities. No place to hear the unfurling of leaves in spring, or the rustle of an insect's wings. But perhaps it is because I am a savage and do not understand. The clatter only seems to insult the ears."
Carl Stokes,Cities,There is nothing fundamentally wrong with America's cities that money can't cure.
Ben Lovett,Cities,"There's no platform for an unsigned music scene in the main cities - it's all hyped acts or showcases behind closed doors. I read about artists that are doing it 'the old-fashioned way' and touring, as if that's a unique thing to do - well, that should just be the way it is."

Blake Mycoskie,Cities,"Traveling as much as I do, I get lonely sometimes.

With my guy friends, I can show up once a month and go to dinner with them and they're happy."

Jane Austen,Cities,We do not look in our great cities for our best morality.
B. W. Powe,Cities,"We have to learn how to contact one another over an enormous land space, across five-and-a-half time zones, in what as once a wilderness of scattered settlements, in what is now a sprawl of suburban edge cities and satellite towns. Technology forges connections and disconnections here."
Ann Coulter,Cities,"We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war."
John F. Kennedy,Cities,"We will neglect our cities to our peril, for in neglecting them we neglect the nation."
Joseph Brodsky,Cities,"What I like about cities is that everything is king size, the beauty and the ugliness."

Buffalo Bill,Cities,You who live your lives in cities or among peaceful ways cannot always tell whether your friends are the kind who would go through fire for you. But on the Plains one's friends have an opportunity to prove their mettle.

James Fenimore Cooper,Civilization,"Equality, in a social sense, may be divided into that of condition and that of rights. Equality of condition is incompatible with civilization, and is found only to exist in those communities that are but slightly removed from the savage state. In practice, it can only mean a common misery."

Robert Louis Stevenson,Civilization,"For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilization, and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints."

David Herbert Lawrence,Civilization,"I am sure no other civilization, not even the Romans, has showed such a vast proportion of ignominious and degraded nudity, and ugly, squalid dirty sex. Because no other civilization has driven sex into the underworld, and nudity to the W.C."
Frantz Fanon,Civilization,"I ascribe a basic importance to the phenomenon of language. To speak means to be in a position to use a certain syntax, to grasp the morphology of this or that language, but it means above all to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization."
Albert Einstein,Civilization,I do not believe that civilization will be wiped out in a war fought with the atomic bomb. Perhaps two-thirds of the people of the earth will be killed.

Henry S. Haskins,Civilization,It is only an uncivilized world that would worship civilization.
Ben Shapiro,Civilization,"It is possible to take the story of Noah figuratively, although virtually every Near East ancient civilization has its own version of the flood story (including the amoral epic of Gilgamesh)."
Barbara Ehrenreich,Civilization,"It seems to me that there must be an ecological limit to the number of paper pushers the earth can sustain, and that human civilization will collapse when the number of, say, tax lawyers exceeds the world's total population of farmers, weavers, fisherpersons, and pediatric nurses."
Victor Hugo,Civilization,Jesus wept; Voltaire smiled. From that divine tear and from that human smile is derived the grace of present civilization.

Max Lerner,Civilization,"Next to the striking of fire and the discovery of the wheel, the greatest triumph of what we call civilization was the domestication of the human male."

Ralph Waldo Emerson,Civilization,"Sunday is the core of our civilization, dedicated to thought and reverence."

Henry James,Civilization,The face of nature and civilization in this our country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field. But it will yield its secrets only to a really grasping imagination. To write well and worthily of American things one need even more than elsewhere to be a master.
Oscar Wilde,Civilization,"The fact is, that civilization requires slaves. Human slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralizing. On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends."

William J. Durant,Civilization,The family is the nucleus of civilization.
Cyril Connolly,Civilization,"The goal of every culture is to decay through over-civilization; the factors of decadence,  luxury, skepticism, weariness and superstition,  are constant. The civilization of one epoch becomes the manure of the next."

Raymond Chandler,Civilization,"The keynote of American civilization is a sort of warm-hearted vulgarity. The Americans have none of the irony of the English, none of their cool poise, none of their manner. But they do have friendliness. Where an Englishman would give you his card, an American would very likely give you his shirt."
Sigmund Freud,Civilization,The liberty of the individual is no gift of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization.
Carl Sagan,Civilization,"The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well"
Mikhail Gorbachev,Civilization,The market came with the dawn of civilization and it is not an invention of capitalism. If it leads to improving the well-being of the people there is no contradiction with socialism.
Mikhail Gorbachev,Civilization,The market is not an invention of capitalism. It has existed for centuries. It is an invention of civilization.

Walter Bagehot,Civilization,"The whole history of civilization is strewn with creeds and institutions which were invaluable at first, and deadly afterwards."
Henry Miller,Civilization,"The word ''civilization'' to my mind is coupled with death. When I use the word, I see civilization as a crippling, thwarting thing, a stultifying thing. For me it was always so. I don't believe in the golden ages, you see... civilization is the arteriosclerosis of culture."
Alva Myrdal,Civilization,"The world generally speaking is now drifting on a more and more devastating course towards the absurd target of extermination - or rather, to be more exact - of the northern hemisphere's towns, fields, and the people who have developed our civilization."
Aharon Appelfeld,Civilization,"The writer in western civilization has become not a voice of his tribe, but of his individuality. This is a very narrow-minded situation."

Victor Hugo,Civilization,"To rescue from oblivion even a fragment of a language which men have used and which is in danger of being lost - that is to say, one of the elements, whether good or bad, which have shaped and complicated civilization - is to extend the scope of social observation and to serve civilization."

Anthony Burgess,Civilization,"We are supposed to be the children of Seth; but Seth is too much of an effete nonentity to deserve ancestral regard. No, we are the sons of Cain, and with violence can be associated the attacks on sound, stone, wood and metal that produced civilization."

Kurt Vonnegut Jr,Civilization,"We would be a lot safer if the Government would take its money out of science and put it into astrology and the reading of palms. Only in superstition is there hope.

Carl Sagan,Civilization,We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.
Carl Sagan,Civilization,"We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,Colleges,"The colleges, while they provide us with libraries, furnish no professors of books; and I think no chair is so much needed."
Abraham Lincoln,Colleges,"Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges. Let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs. Let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in the courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation."

Bryce Dallas Howard,Colleges,"I didn't always want to act. My passion was writing, and it still is one of my primary passions to this day, but it wasn't until high school when I started acting in plays that it became a thought of something I might want to do. And when I applied to colleges, at NYU, I was able to study both writing and acting."

Alistair Cooke,Colleges,These doomsday warriors look no more like soldiers than the soldiers of the Second World War looked like conquistadors. The more expert they become the more they look like lab assistants in small colleges.
Ralph Waldo Emerson,Colleges,"We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a belly-full of words and do not know a thing. The things taught in schools and colleges are not an education, but the means of education."
Abraham Robinson,Colleges,"We conclude that, simultaneously with the organization of the colleges, there should be at Santa Cruz an organization by disciplines, whose units would have a voice in appointments and promotions, in course of programs, and in the allocation of funds for research."
Arthur Capper,Colleges,"We spend more than a million dollars a year on our colleges and university, and it is money well spent; but we must have education that fits not the few but the many for the business of life."

Alan Cohen,Commitment,"After you have made your commitment to say no to what no longer serves you, you will probably be invited to demonstrate that you really mean it."
John W. Gardner,Commitment,America's greatness has been the greatness of a free people who shared certain moral commitments. Freedom without moral commitment is aimless and promptly self-destructive.

Cass Sunstein,Commitment,"Democrats pride themselves on their commitment to science. Citing climate change, they contend that they are the party of truth, while Republicans are 'denialists.' But with respect to genetically modified organisms, many Democrats seem indifferent to science, and to be practicing a denialism of their own - perhaps more so than Republicans."
Mario Andretti,Commitment,"Desire is the key to motivation, but it's the determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek."
Al Sharpton,Commitment,Dr. King used Gandhi's commitment to non-violence and to passive resistance.
Camille Paglia,Commitment,"Earisome as it may seem, women must realize that, in making a commitment to a man, they have merged in his unconscious with his mother and have therefore inherited the ambivalence of that relationship."
Bob Beauprez,Commitment,"Education is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations."
Jean Baudrillard,Commitment,Governing today means giving acceptable signs of credibility. It is like advertising and it is the same effect that is achieved - commitment to a scenario.

Robert Conklin,Commitment,"If you make the unconditional commitment to reach your most important goals, if the strength of your decision is sufficient, you will find the way and the power to achieve your goals."
Brett Hoebel,Commitment,"If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym, you're missing the point completely. If you think that going on a diet has something to do with nutrition, you don't see the forest through the trees. It is a lifestyle. I know it sounds cliche, but you have to find things you love to do."
Dr. Joyce Brothers,Commitment,"If your energy is as boundless as your ambition, total commitment may be a way of life you should seriously consider."

Al Sharpton,Commitment,"It is true that Mr. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, after which there was a commitment to give 40 acres and a mule. That's where the argument, to this day, of reparations starts. We never got the 40 acres. We went all the way to Herbert Hoover, and we never got the 40 acres. We didn't get the mule. So we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us."
Scott O'Grady,Commitment,"It wasn't the reward that mattered or the recognition you might harvest. It was your depth of commitment, your quality of service, the product of your devotion - these were the things that counted in a life.

George William Curtis,control,"Anger, even when it punishes the faults of delinquents, ought not to precede reason as its mistress, but attend as a handmaid at the back of reason, to come to the front when bidden. For once it begins to take control of the mind, it calls just what it does cruelly."
Carre Otis,control,"Anorexia was there for me before I got into modeling, but because of the arena and the demands, the disease really got out of control for me. It's like being an alcoholic and going and being a bartender."
B. D. Wong,control,"As an actor, I have casting issues. I'm a minority. I don't have trouble making a living, but as far as being on the food chain of the pecking order of actors, I'm not at the top of it. With the jobs that I do, there are always control issues with directors and producers."

Camille Paglia,control,"Feminism has tried to dismiss the femme fatale as a misogynist libel, a hoary cliche. But the femme fatale expresses woman's ancient and eternal control of the sexual realm. The specter of the femme fatale stalks all of men's relationships with women."

Brian Tracy,control,Goals allow you to control the direction of change in your favor.
Ralph W. Sockman,control,"Good habits, which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic control, leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences of life. Too many of us divide and dissipate our energies in debating actions which should be taken for granted."

Ben Foster,control,"I'm learning not to hold on so tightly to my solitude. It's not an economical way to work. A driver would call it 'white-knuckling.'

Joan Didion,control,"I'm totally in control of this tiny, tiny world right there at the typewriter."

Cass Sunstein,control,"If you have an architecture of control, let's say, where you select in advance everything that's going to affect your life, then you're going to live in a very small world that will have an echo chamber feature... Pandora, which I love, actually feeds into that."

Ben Carson,control,"In general I was a good kid. It usually took a lot to make me mad. But once I reached the boiling point, I lost all rational control. Totally without thinking, when my anger was aroused, I grabbed the nearest brick, rock, or stick to bash someone. It was as if I had no conscious will in the matter."

Arthur Eddington,control,It is one thing for the human mind to extract from the phenomena of nature the laws which it has itself put into them; it may be a far harder thing to extract laws over which it has no control.

Barbara Sher,control,It's essential to distinguish between events that are really beyond your control and events you caused yourself.

Camille Paglia,control,"Judaism's campaign to make divinity invisible has never fully succeeded. Images are always eluding moral control, creating the brilliant western art tradition. Idolatry is fascism of the eye. The western eye will be served, with or without the consent of conscience."
Bryant H. McGill,control,"Knowledge is that possession that no misfortune can destroy, no authority can revoke, and no enemy can control. This makes knowledge the greatest of all freedoms."

Denis Waitley,control,"Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now."
Carol Shields,control,"Learning to skip has brought control into her life. Whenever she feels all sad, she switches into this wholly happy gait, sliding, hopping, and sliding again; when doing this, it seems as though her head separates from her body, making her feel dizzy and emptied out of bad thoughts. Does anyone else know this trick, she wonders? Probably not, although her Mother sometimes smiles and waves from the window."

Cass Sunstein,control,"Many progressives understand Scalia, and other conservative judges, in crassly political terms - as opponents of affirmative action, abortion, gun control, and campaign finance legislation. But what Scalia cared most about was clear, predictable rules, laid down in advance."

Kenneth Branagh,control,My definition of success is control.
Barbara Corcoran,control,My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There's no way I can control him. I wouldn't stay married to him if I felt I could.

Caitlin Doughty,control,"Not only is natural burial by far the most ecologically sound way to perish, it doubles down on the fear of fragmentation and loss of control.

Mahatma Gandhi,control,"Not to have control over the senses is like sailing in a rudderless ship, bound to break to pieces on coming in contact with the very first rock."

Norman Vincent Peale,control,"Once we roared like lions for liberty; now we bleat like sheep for security! The solution for America's problem is not in terms of big government, but it is in big men over whom nobody stands in control but God."
Carl Rogers,control,"One of the most satisfying experiences I know is fully to appreciate an individual in the same way I appreciate a sunset. When I look at a sunset... I don't find myself saying, 'Soften the orange a little more on the right hand corner, and put a bit more purple along the base, and use a little more pink in the cloud color...' I don't try to control a sunset. I watch it with awe as it unfolds."

Theodore Harold White,control,Power in America today is control of the means of communication.
Ben Shapiro,control,President Obama and members of his administration constantly express rage and anger over events totally within their control. It's an odd and unsettling fact of American life that so many Americans seem to think that such expressions of frustration should substitute for actual competence.
Bev Perdue,control,"President Obama is also standing up for women in North Carolina and across our country. He has helped women fight for equal pay for equal work; he has fought to guarantee that women have access to quality, affordable health care, including making sure that insurance plans cover birth control with no out-of-pocket cost."
Abraham Lincoln,control,Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes crimes out of things that are not crimes.
Abraham Lincoln,control,"Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and loss of self control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite."
Alfred A. Montapert,control,"Question: Why are we Masters of our Fate, the captains of our souls? Because we have the power to control our thoughts, our attitudes. That is why many people live in the withering negative world. That is why many people live in the Positive Faith world."

Ben Parr,control,Sharing with just your friends doesn't protect your privacy. I know the people at Facebook will disagree and argue that users can control what is shared with whom. But this is simply an illusion that makes us feel better about all the sharing we have done and are about to do.
Bell Hooks,control,"Since anti-racist individuals did not control mass media, the media became the primary tool that would be used and is still used to convince black viewers, and everyone else, of black inferiority."

Your mind is a shrieking, gibbering madhouse on wheels barreling pell-mell down the hill, utterly out of control and helpless. No problem. You are not crazier than you were yesterday. It has always been this way, and you just never noticed.... So don't let this realization unsettle you. It is a milestone actually, a sign of real progress."

Aaron Brown,control,Television is the most perfect democracy. You sit there with your remote control and vote.
Phyllis Schlafly,control,The advance planning and sense stimuli employed to capture a $10 million cigarette or soap market are nothing compared to the brainwashing and propaganda blitzes used to ensure control of the largest cash market in the world: the Executive Branch of the United States Government.

Charles Darwin,control,The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control our thoughts.
Charles Horton Cooley,control,"The human mind is indeed a cave swarming with strange forms of life, most of them unconscious and unilluminated. Unless we can understand something as to how the motives that issue from this obscurity are generated, we can hardly hope to foresee or control them."

Bill Bryson,criminals,"There'd never been a more advantageous time to be a criminal in America than during the 13 years of Prohibition.

Ann Druyan,culture,"I've been thinking about the distorted view of science that prevails in our culture. I've been wondering about this, because our civilization is completely dependent on science and high technology, yet most of us are alienated from science."
John F. Kennedy,culture,"If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him."
Barbara Kruger,culture,"If most American cities are about the consumption of culture, Los Angeles and New York are about the production of culture - not only national culture but global culture."
Bob Diamond,culture,"If someone can't behave with their colleagues and can't be part of the culture, it doesn't matter how good they are at what they do; they have to be asked to leave."
Margaret Mead,culture,"If we are to achieve a richer culture, rich in contrasting values, we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities, and so weave a less arbitrary social fabric, one in which each diverse human gift will find a fitting place."
Burgess Owens,culture,"If you apologize to me, I look at it as an insult because my parents, my grandparents, my great-grandparents, like every other culture out there, did exactly what they needed to do. They worked hard, and they became part of the American way, and they earned the respect of Americans across the board. We need to do the same."
Anais Nin,culture,"If you do not breathe through writing, if you do not cry out in writing, or sing in writing, then don't write, because our culture has no use for it."
S. I. Hayakawa,culture,"If you see in any given situation only what everybody else can see, you can be said to be so much a representative of your culture that you are a victim of it."
Carlos Slim,culture,"In high school, I loved history. I also loved cosmography, algebra. Mexico is so rich in culture and history, and I have always enjoyed that."
Carroll Quigley,culture,In its final stages the civilization becomes a dualism of almost totalitarian imperial power and an amorphous mass culture of atomized individuals.
Arthur C. Brooks,culture,"In my book I don't just demonstrate that free enterprise is the most efficient way of organizing an economy - which it is. I also show that it's an expression of American values, and, thus, that a fight for free enterprise is very much a fight for our culture."
Ben Affleck,culture,"In our culture, we get very much into shorthanding people. And I got shorthanded as That Guy: Jennifer Lopez, movies bombed, therefore he must be a sort of thoughtless dilettante, solipsistic consumer blahblahblah. It's hard to shake those sort of narratives."
Carl Honore,culture,"In our fast-forward culture, we have lost the art of eating well. Food is often little more than fuel to pour down the hatch while doing other stuff - surfing the Web, driving, walking along the street. Dining al desko is now the norm in many workplaces. All of this speed takes a toll. Obesity, eating disorders and poor nutrition are rife."
Alan Dundes,culture,"In the light of our culture, these are not unreasonable questions and tactics, but if once again, we try to see the lens through which we look, we can see that there is far too great an emphasis placed on the future."
Bell Hooks,culture,"In this culture, the phrase 'black woman' is not synonymous with 'tender,' or 'gentle.' It's as if those words couldn't possibly speak to the reality of black females."
Carl Honore,culture,"In this media-drenched, multitasking, always-on age, many of us have forgotten how to unplug and immerse ourselves completely in the moment. We have forgotten how to slow down. Not surprisingly, this fast-forward culture is taking a toll on everything from our diet and health to our work and the environment."
Buffy Sainte-Marie,culture,"Instead of kids just hearing about beads and baskets and fringe, and about what 'was' and 'were,' we present Native American culture as a living contemporary culture."
Brad D. Smith,culture,"Intuit's mission, values, and culture of innovation set us apart as a great place to work. Our 8,000 employees are innovators and entrepreneurs that are inspired by the important work they do that is delighting customers and improving the financial lives of millions of people."
Anthony Bourdain,culture,Is there a sharper commentary on American culture and the world than The Simpsons?
W. H. Auden,culture,It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.
Greil Marcus,culture,It is a sure sign that a culture has reached a dead end when it is no longer intrigued by its myths.
Arthur Golden,culture,"It is confusing, because in this culture we really don't have anything that corresponds to geisha."
Northrop Frye,culture,It is of the essence of imaginative culture that it transcends the limits both of the naturally possible and of the morally acceptable.
Bill Dedman,culture,"It may be no surprise that Pittsburgh has direct flights to London, Paris and Frankfurt, but consider this: many of the tourists here have come from Europe to the capital of culture in the Alleghenies."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,culture,"It seems to me that, in every culture, I come across a chapter headed ''Wisdom.'' And then I know exactly what is going to follow: ''Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.''"
Bill McKibben,culture,"It worries me because it alters perception. TV, and the culture it anchors, and drowns out the subtle and vital information contact with the real world once provided."
Antoine Fuqua,culture,"It's not worth it, it's not about money, especially when you're dealing with a culture. It should be about elevating the idea of what we are and who we are as people in the cinema, and that kind of stuff keeps dragging us back down."
Ralph Waldo Emerson,culture,It's the proof of high culture to say the greatest matters in the simplest way.
Alberto Tomba,culture,"It's typical of Italian culture that we only start to feel emotional about something when we have the possibility to see it in front of us. By February, Italy will have Olympic fever."
Carol Bartz,culture,"It's very, very hard to affect culture. And you can get surprised thinking you're farther down the path of change than you really are because, frankly, most of us like the way things are."
Susan Sontag,culture,"Jews and homosexuals are the outstanding creative minorities in contemporary urban culture. Creative, that is, in the truest sense: they are creators of sensibilities. The two pioneering forces of modern sensibility are Jewish moral seriousness and homosexual aestheticism and irony."
Carl Bernstein,culture,"John Paul was the first modern pope to grow up in a secular culture: He attended public schools, danced with girls - indeed, as a teenager he had a crush on a beautiful Jewish girl who fled his hometown just ahead of the arrival of the Germans."
Pat Buchanan,culture,"Just as there's garbage that pollutes the Potomac river, there is garbage polluting our culture. We need an Environmental Protection Agency to clean it up."
Bill Condon,culture,"Kinsey was trying to study sex scientifically, get rid of the overlay of culture and religion."
Camille Paglia,culture,Lacan is a tyrant who must be driven from our shores. Narrowly trained English professors who know nothing of art history or popular culture think they can just wade in with Lacan and trash everything in sight.
Albert J. Nock,culture,"Learning has always been made much of, but forgetting has always been deprecated; therefore pedantry has pretty well established itself throughout the modern world at the expense of culture."
Mao Tse-Tung,culture,Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the policy for promoting the progress of the arts and the sciences and a flourishing culture in our land.
Aldous Huxley,culture,"Like every other good thing in this world, leisure and culture have to be paid for. Fortunately, however, it is not the leisured and the cultured who have to pay."
Barbara Kruger,culture,Listen: our culture is saturated with irony whether we know it or not.
Ben Bernanke,culture,"Long term, I have a lot of confidence in the United States. We have an excellent record in terms of innovation. We have great universities that are involved in technological change and progress. We have an entrepreneurial culture, much more than almost any other country."
Baltasar Gracian,culture,"Man is born a barbarian, and only raises himself above the beast by culture."
Erich Fromm,culture,Man's biological weakness is the condition of human culture.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,culture,"Mexico and the U.S. are bound not only because of the common border, but by a shared culture and history."
Benazir Bhutto,culture,"Military dictatorship is born from the power of the gun, and so it undermines the concept of the rule of law and gives birth to a culture of might, a culture of weapons, violence and intolerance."
Arthur Hertzberg,culture,"Most American Jews came from the lower middle classes, and therefore they brought with them not a lot of Jewish culture. The American Jewish story starts with Ellis Island, and the candy store in the Bronx."
Camille Paglia,culture,"Most of western culture is a distortion of reality. But reality should be distorted; that is, imaginatively amended. The Buddhist acquiescence to nature is neither accurate about nature nor just to human potential."
Barbara Kingsolver,culture,Motherhood is so sentimentalised and romanticised in our culture. It's practically against the law to say there are moments in the day when you hate your children. Everyone actually has those moments.
Edith Wharton,culture,"Mrs. Ballinger is one of the ladies who pursue Culture in bands, as though it were dangerous to meet it alone."
Bill Walton,culture,"Music is critical in our lives and culture. It's the inspiration that drives us. It's also the window to our souls. It's a reflection as to who we are, what we stand for and where we're going."
James Kelman,culture,"My culture and my language have the right to exist, and no one has the authority to dismiss that."
Brin-Jonathan Butler,culture,"My mother left Hungary as a refugee, and she is not nostalgic for the life that she had back in Hungary, and yet Cubans certainly want the economic opportunity in the United States, but they're desperately homesick for the culture that they left behind."
Busta Rhymes,culture,"My thinking is that if we're going to take from a culture, let's take from a culture that has exemplified success for thousands of years."
Antonin Artaud,culture,"Never tire yourself more than necessary, even if you have to found a culture on the fatigue of your bones."
Mahatma Gandhi,culture,No culture can live if it attempts to be exclusive.
Barry Lopez,culture,"No culture has yet solved the dilemma each has faced with the growth of a conscious mind: how to live a moral and compassionate existence when one is fully aware of the blood, the horror inherent in all life, when one finds darkness not only in one's own culture but within oneself... There are simply no answers to some of the great pressing questions. You continue to live them out, making your life a worthy expression of a leaning into the light."
Barbara Ehrenreich,culture,"No culture on earth outside of mid-century suburban America has ever deployed one woman per child without simultaneously assigning her such major productive activities as weaving, farming, gathering, temple maintenance, and tent-building. The reason is that full-time, one-on-one child-raising is not good for women or children."
Thomas Jefferson,culture,"No occupation is so delightful to me as the culture of the earth, and no culture comparable to that of the garden."
James Baldwin,culture,No people come into possession of a culture without having paid a heavy price for it.
Frank Lloyd Wright,culture,Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.
Oscar Wilde,culture,"Nobody of any real culture, for instance, ever talks nowadays about the beauty of sunset. Sunsets are quite old fashioned. To admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism of temperament. Upon the other hand they go on."
Robert Warshow,culture,"Nobody seriously questions the principle that it is the function of mass culture to maintain public morale, and certainly nobody in the mass audience objects to having his morale maintained."
Salman Rushdie,culture,"Not even the visionary or mystical experience ever lasts very long. It is for art to capture that experience, to offer it to, in the case of literature, its readers; to be, for a secular, materialist culture, some sort of replacement for what the love of god offers in the world of faith."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,culture,"Not every religion has to have St. Augustine's attitude to sex. Why even in our culture marriages are celebrated in a church, everyone present knows what is going to happen that night, but that doesn't prevent it being a religious ceremony."
Marilyn Ferguson,culture,"Of all the self-fulfilling prophecies in our culture, the assumption that aging means decline and poor health is probably the deadliest."
Beth Ditto,culture,"Olympia was a town crawling with music. I was new to the whole punk scene. The culture shock continued; Olympia had bagels! We didn't have bagels in Arkansas. You could order vegetarian food all over town! It was so crazy to me - a place with so many vegetarians, the restaurants made special dishes for them?"
Ignazio Silone,culture,"On a group of theories one can found a school; but on a group of values one can found a culture, a civilization, a new way of living together among men."
Jean de la Bruyère,culture,"One should never risk a joke, even of the mildest and most unexceptional charters, except among people of culture and wit."
Caroline Knapp,culture,"Our culture thrives on black-and-white narratives, clearly defined emotions, easy endings, and so, this thrust into complexity exhausts."
Bobby Jindal,culture,"Our culture, language, history, and values are vital to uniting us as a nation."
Carlos Slim,culture,"Our philosophy is you need to give nonprofit money for health, nutrition, education, culture, and sports."
Beck,culture,Our whole culture in this country now is so conformist. I don't even meet that many freaks any more.
Susan Sontag,culture,"Ours is a culture based on excess, on overproduction; the result is a steady loss of sharpness in our sensory experience. All the conditions of modern life - its material plenitude, its sheer crowdedness - conjoin to dull our sensory faculties."
Christian Nevell Bovee,culture,"Partial culture runs to the ornate, extreme culture to simplicity."
Assata Shakur,culture,"People ask me if I miss the States. I miss African Americans. But not the U.S. government or all the things they put me through. I miss African American culture, our speech, dance and cooking."
Carole Bouquet,culture,"People have to identify with their own stories, with their own lives, so a movie belongs to a country and to a culture. Sometimes we can share, but it's very rare."
Brian Friel,culture,"People with a culture of poverty suffer much less from repression than we of the middle class suffer and indeed, if I may make the suggestion with due qualification, they often have a hell of a lot more fun than we have."
Raoul Vaneigem,culture,"People without imagination are beginning to tire of the importance attached to comfort, to culture, to leisure, to all that destroys imagination. This means that people are not really tired of comfort, culture and leisure, but of the use to which they are"
Amy Tan,culture,Placing on writers the responsibility to represent a culture is an onerous burden.
Camille Paglia,culture,"Popular culture is the new Babylon, into which so much art and intellect now flow. It is our imperial sex theater, supreme temple of the western eye. We live in the age of idols. The pagan past, never dead, flames again in our mystic hierarchies of stardom."
Biz Stone,culture,"Positive culture comes from being mindful, and respecting your coworkers, and being empathetic."
Atal Bihari Vajpayee,culture,"Poverty is multidimensional. It extends beyond money incomes to education, health care, political participation and advancement of one's own culture and social organisation."
Raoul Vaneigem,culture,"Production and consumption are the nipples of modern society. Thus suckled, humanity grows in strength and beauty; rising standard of living, all modern conveniences, distractions of all kinds, culture for all, the comfort of your dreams."
John Berger,culture,Publicity is the life of this culture. Without publicity capitalism could not survive and at the same time publicity is its dream.
Carl Honore,culture,"Slow travel now rivals the fly-to-Barcelona-for-lunch culture. Advocates savour the journey, travelling by train or boat or bicycle, or even on foot, rather than crammed into an airplane. They take time to plug into the local culture instead of racing through a list of tourist traps."
Boris Kodjoe,culture,"Sometimes in the black culture, being raised as an independent woman is misconstrued as someone who doesn't need a man. I think that's wrong. I think we all need someone."
Basil Bunting,culture,Sooner or later we must absorb Islam if our own culture is not to die of anemia.
Bruce Schneier,culture,Technical problems can be remediated. A dishonest corporate culture is much harder to fix.
Clive Barnes,culture,"Television is the first truly democratic culture, the first culture available to everybody and entirely governed by what the people want. the most terrifying thing is what people do want."
John Burroughs,culture,"Temperament lies behind mood; behind will, lies the fate of character. Then behind both, the influence of family the tyranny of culture; and finally the power of climate and environment; and we are free, only to the extent we rise above these."
Henry Ward Beecher,culture,That is true culture which helps us to work for the social betterment of all.
Roland Barthes,culture,"The bastard form of mass culture is humiliated repetition... always new books, new programs, new films, news items, but always the same meaning."
Richard Dawkins,culture,"The Bible should be taught, but emphatically not as reality. It is fiction, myth, poetry, anything but reality. As such it needs to be taught because it underlies so much of our literature and our culture.,
"
George Grosz,culture,"The bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie have armed themselves against the rising proletariat with, among other things, ''culture.'' It's an old ploy of the bourgeoisie. They keep a standing ''art'' to defend their collapsing culture."
Camille Paglia,culture,"The capitalist distribution network, a complex chain of factory, transport, warehouse and retail outlet, is one of the greatest male accomplishments in the history of culture."
Lewis Mumford,culture,"The chief function of the city is to convert power into form, energy into culture, dead matter into the living symbols of art, biological reproduction into social creativity."
Bridgit Mendler,culture,The cool thing about doing a voice-over into a different language is that you get to bring the character of your own culture into it.
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,culture,The diffusion of a universalist culture and of a pedagogy of peace appears more than ever to be the path that we must follow for the salvation of all nations on earth.
Caitlin Moran,culture,"The doughy-faced woman has been forced to sit on the sidelines of culture for too long, and it's now time for us to stand up with our big round faces like the moon and say we have things to say, too. We have a round-faced agenda we want to push."
Bill Griffith,culture,The down side of Americans being obsessed with pop culture is that they kind of like it light.
Barry Ritholtz,culture,"The electronics industry expanded rapidly and the seeds for the semiconductor and software revolution were planted. The postwar period also saw the suburbanization of America, the rise of the homeowner, the build-out of the interstate highway system, and the rise of automobile culture. Credit availability expanded dramatically."
George Eliot,culture,"The floods of nonsense printed in the form of critical opinions seem to me a chief curse of the times, a chief obstacle to true culture."
Lionel Trilling,culture,"The function of literature, through all its mutations, has been to make us aware of the particularity of selves, and the high authority of the self in its quarrel with its society and its culture. Literature is in that sense subversive."
Anna Quindlen,culture,"The future is built on brains, not prom court, as most people can tell you after attending their high school reunion. But you'd never know it by talking to kids or listening to the messages they get from the culture and even from their schools."
Barry Sanders,culture,The game is the ultimate significance to me because it is so important to a lot of people. It has left a mark on our culture to be voted as one of the best to ever play.
Cyril Connolly,culture,"The goal of every culture is to decay through over-civilization; the factors of decadence,  luxury, skepticism, weariness and superstition,  are constant. The civilization of one epoch becomes the manure of the next."
Susan Sontag,culture,"The hard truth is that what may be acceptable in elite culture may not be acceptable in mass culture, that tastes which pose only innocent ethical issues as the property of a minority become corrupting when they become more established. Taste is context, and the context has changed."
Midge Decter,culture,"The hatred of the youth culture for adult society is not a disinterested judgment but a terror-ridden refusal to be hooked into the, if you will, ecological chain of breathing, growing, and dying. It is the demand, in other words, to remain children."
Charles Darwin,culture,The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control our thoughts.
Salman Rushdie,culture,"The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas - uncertainty, progress, change - into crimes."
Carl Sandburg,culture,The impact of television on our culture is... indescribable. There's a certain sense in which it is nearly as important as the invention of printing.
Ben Nicholson,culture,"The Irish and British, they love satire, it's a large part of the culture."
Alvin Toffler,culture,"The Law of Raspberry Jam: the wider any culture is spread, the thinner it gets."
Carl Sagan,culture,"The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well"
Jean Baudrillard,culture,"The local is a shabby thing. There's nothing worse than bringing us back down to our own little corner, our own territory, the radiant promiscuity of the face to face. A culture which has taken the risk of the universal, must perish by the universal."
Carl Bernstein,culture,"The lowest form of popular culture - lack of information, misinformation, disinformation and a contempt for the truth or the reality of most people's lives - has overrun real journalism."
Carl Bernstein,culture,"The lowest form of popular culture - lack of information, misinformation, disinformation, and a contempt for the truth or the reality of most people's lives - has overrun real journalism. Today, ordinary Americans are being stuffed with garbage."
Carl Bernstein,culture,"The lowest form of popular culture - lack of information, misinformation, misinformation, and a contempt for the truth or the reality of most people's lives - has overrun real journalism. Today, ordinary Americans are being stuffed with garbage."
Gerald Early,culture,"The Miss America contest is the most perfectly rendered theater in our culture, for it so perfectly captures what we yearn for: a low-class ritual, a polished restatement of vulgarity, that wants to open the door to high-class respectability by way of plain middle-class anxiety and ambition."
Bernard Pivot,culture,"The more English is heard in the world, the more gratifying it seems to speak French, and above all to know the culture of our country. They find a kind of French social grace in the language and culture."
Gloria Steinem,culture,"The origins of violence against women by men are not biological. If that were the case, it would exist in every culture. And it doesn't exist in every culture."
Al Franken,culture,The point is that there is tremendous hypocrisy among the Christian right. And I think that Christian voters should start looking at global warming and extreme poverty as a religious issue that speaks to the culture of life.
Al Sharpton,culture,"The promise of America is one immigration policy for all who seek to enter our shores, whether they come from Mexico, Haiti or Canada, there must be one set of rules for everybody. We cannot welcome those to come and then try and act as though any culture will not be respected or treated inferior. We cannot look at the Latino community and preach 'one language.' No one gave them an English test before they sent them to Iraq to fight for America."
Camille Paglia,culture,"The prostitute is not, as feminists claim, the victim of men but rather their conqueror, an outlaw who controls the sexual channel between nature and culture."
Harold Rosenberg,culture,"The purpose of education is to keep a culture from being drowned in senseless repetitions, each of which claims to offer a new insight."
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,culture,"The return to the Organization of the United States of America, the bearers of a great and diversified democratic culture that has inspired many other peoples."
Marshall Mcluhan,culture,"The school system, custodian of print culture, has no place for the rugged individual. It is, indeed, the homogenizing hopper into which we toss our integral tots for processing."
C. P. Snow,culture,"The separation between the two cultures has been getting deeper under our eyes; there is now precious little communication between them.... The traditional culture... is, of course, mainly literary... the scientific culture is expansive, not restrictive."
Boris Kodjoe,culture,"The Southern Baptist Church is a specific culture in itself. So, I had to study, talk to people, watch tape and go to performances to see how Gospel artists move compared to secular artists."
Jean Dubuffet,culture,"The State has but one face for me: that of the police. To my eyes, all of the State's ministries have this single face, and I cannot imagine the ministry of culture other than as the police of culture, with its prefect and commissioners."
Sigmund Freud,culture,"The tendency of aggression is an innate, independent, instinctual disposition in man... it constitutes the most powerful obstacle to culture."
Bob Schieffer,culture,"The truth is the Super Bowl long ago became more than just a football game. It's part of our culture like turkey at Thanksgiving and lights at Christmas, and like those holidays beyond their meaning, a factor in our economy."
Freda Adler,culture,The type of fig leaf which each culture employs to cover its social taboos offers a twofold description of its morality. It reveals that certain unacknowledged behavior exists and it suggests the form that such behavior takes.
Carl Sagan,culture,"The uniqueness of humans has been claimed on many grounds, but most often because of our tool-making, culture, language, reason and morality. We have them, the other animals don't, and - so the argument goes - that's that."
Lewis Mumford,culture,The vast material displacements the machine has made in our physical environment are perhaps in the long run less important than its spiritual contributions to our culture.
Anderson Cooper,culture,"The whole celebrity culture thing - I'm fascinated by, and repelled by, and yet I end up knowing about it."
Junot Diaz,culture,"The whole culture is telling you to hurry, while the art tells you to take your time. Always listen to the art."
Henry Miller,culture,"The word ''civilization'' to my mind is coupled with death. When I use the word, I see civilization as a crippling, thwarting thing, a stultifying thing. For me it was always so. I don't believe in the golden ages, you see... civilization is the arteriosclerosis of culture."
Bjorn Ulvaeus,culture,"There are still many places I haven't seen that I'd like to travel to. I've never seen the Pyramids, and I'd love to explore the culture in North India. I think walking in the Andes would also be awesome."
Bob Woodward,culture,"There is a garbage culture out there, where we pour garbage on people. Then the pollsters run around and take a poll and say, do you smell anything?"
Thornton T. Munger,culture,"There is no road to success but through a clear strong purpose. Nothing can take its place. A purpose underlies character, culture, position, attainment of every part."
George Steiner,culture,There is something terribly wrong with a culture inebriated by noise and gregariousness.
Ben Goldacre,culture,There is this peculiar blind spot in the culture of academic medicine around whether withholding trial results is research misconduct. People who work in any industry can reinforce each others' ideas about what is okay.
Benedict Cumberbatch,culture,"There's a huge raft of roles that actors in our culture perform, and you can see any one of about three Hamlets in a year. It's not something to be completely daunted by."
Billie Jean King,culture,"They're not put on earth to be martyrs; they have to want to come out. It depends on your culture, where you work, where you live. Each person's circumstances are unique."
Arthur Erickson,culture,"This great, though disastrous, culture can only change as we begin to stand off and see... the inveterate materialism which has become the model for cultures around the world."
Betty Carter,culture,"This is our culture, and I don't care who the musician is, if he avoids black people, then he is scared of something. He doesn't have confidence in himself or else he doesn't believe in what he's doing."
Oscar Wilde,culture,"To give an accurate description of what has never occurred is not merely the proper occupation of the historian, but the inalienable privilege of any man of parts and culture."
Aleister Crowley,culture,"To the eyes of a god, mankind must appear as a species of bacteria which multiply and become progressively virulent whenever they find themselves in a congenial culture, and whose activity diminishes until they disappear completely as soon as proper measures are taken to sterilize them."
Leslie Fiedler,culture,"Unless criticism refuses to take itself quite so seriously or at least to permit its readers not to, it will inevitably continue to reflect the finicky canons of the genteel tradition and the depressing pieties of the Culture Religion of Modernism."
Armstrong Williams,culture,"Very simply, the culture of another people does not have to be accepted when it is subhuman!"
Kofi Annan,culture,"Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation, and it is perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth. As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equality, development and peace."
Karl Wilhelm Von Humboldt,culture,War seems to be one of the most salutary phenomena for the culture of human nature; and it is not without regret that I see it disappearing more and more from the scene.
R. D. Laing,culture,"We are all murderers and prostitutes - no matter to what culture, society, class, nation one belongs, no matter how normal, moral, or mature, one takes oneself to be."
Carl Bernstein,culture,"We are in the process of creating what deserves to be called the idiot culture. Not an idiot sub-culture, which every society has bubbling beneath the surface and which can provide harmless fun; but the culture itself. For the first time, the weird and the stupid and the coarse are becoming our cultural norm, even our cultural ideal."
Max Lerner,culture,"We cannot live by power, and a culture that seeks to live by it becomes brutal and sterile. But we can die without it."
Bartlett Sher,culture,"We get a lot of raps as Americans for being small-minded, but in fact, when you really drill down to the core of the culture, there's an enormous amount of compassion and forgiveness and support."
Abdul Kalam,culture,"We have not invaded anyone. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them."
Ben Barnes,culture,"We live in a youth-obsessed, aesthetically obsessed culture. That is no more evident than in the film industry."
Stephen Vizinczey,culture,We now have a whole culture based on the assumption that people know nothing and so anything can be said to them.
Carl Honore,culture,"We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives - on our health, our diet, our work, our relationships, the environment and our community."
Abdurrahman Wahid,culture,"Well, the most important thing about Islam is that we have to differentiate between two kinds of Islam. The first one is the institution of Islam... second, the culture of Islam."
Camille Paglia,culture,"Western culture from the start has swerved from femaleness. The last western society to worship female powers was Minoan Crete. And significantly, that fell and did not rise again."
Arthur Hertzberg,culture,What are you going to do to preserve a tradition that is the peculiar and unique culture that Judaism inculcates? The American Jewish community is not going to survive by lining up against its common enemy.
Jean Dubuffet,culture,"What culture lacks is the taste for anonymous, innumerable germination. Culture is smitten with counting and measuring; it feels out of place and uncomfortable with the innumerable; its efforts tend, on the contrary, to limit the numbers in all domains; it tries to count on its fingers."
Casey Affleck,culture,"What is acceptable in our culture, I think, is really detrimental. I think we ought to have a little more ownership over the kind of material and the content that we put in front of people, especially young people."
Erich Fromm,culture,What most people in our culture mean by being lovable is essentially a mixture between being popular and having sex appeal.
George Bernard Shaw,culture,"What we call education and culture is for the most part nothing but the substitution of reading for experience, of literature for life, of the obsolete fictitious for the contemporary real."
Karl Kraus,culture,"When a culture feels that its end has come, it sends for a priest."
Boy George,culture,"When Culture Club broke up, I hadn't been going out a lot because we'd been working all the time, so I suddenly had this period of leisure. And it was just around the time that the whole acid house thing kicked off in London."
Bernice Johnson Reagon,culture,When I started graduate school I was interested in the culture of the Civil Rights Movement.
Bobby Keys,culture,"When I talk about rock n' roll, to me, that goes back to the beginning of the 1950s. Blue suede shoes and sideburns, man. Pink and black coloured clothes. Turn your collar up, comb your hair in ducktails. And the music was cool. It was a whole culture then - a different world."
Confucius,culture,"When nature exceeds culture, we have the rustic. When culture exceeds nature then we the pedant."
Bernice Johnson Reagon,culture,"When the culture is strong, you've got this consistency where black people can grow up in these places with this voice just resonating about our special-ness in the universe. And I always say you're in trouble if you get too far away from that core that grounds you."

Benazir Bhutto,democracy,"In 1988, when democracy was restored, the military establishment was still very powerful. The extremist groups were still there.

Tom Stoppard,democracy,"It's not the voting that's democracy, it's the counting."
Benazir Bhutto,democracy,"It's true that General Musharraf opposes my return, seeing me as a symbol of democracy in the country. He is comfortable with dictatorship. I hope better sense prevails."

Barbara Lee,democracy,The last two elections were stolen. They were stolen and so we will not rest until we reclaim our democracy and this is what today is all about.

Barbara Boxer,democracy,"We need to give the Iraqis a chance to build their own future. It should be in their hands. It must be in their hands. That is what democracy is all about. We can teach it, we can explain it, but they must want it enough to make it work for them."

Barry Marshall,doctors,"Before the 20th century, the ulcer was not a respectable disease. Doctors would say, 'You're under a lot of stress.' Nineteenth-century Europe and America had all these crazy health spas and quack treatments."

Carolyn Murphy,doctors,"Giving birth was the most amazing thing I've ever done. I'd been living in a Third World country, and I said, 'I'm going to just squat behind a tree.' I basically did that but in a chair in my living room. I didn't want a sterile hospital room. I didn't want doctors. I had a midwife."
Andrew Taylor Still,doctors,"I began to see during the civil war, in that part of the states of Missouri and Kansas where the doctors were shut out, the children did not die."
Ernest Hemingway,doctors,I have noticed that doctors who fail in the practice of medicine have a tendency to seek one another's company and aid in consultation. A doctor who cannot take out your appendix properly will recommend you to a doctor who will be unable to remove your tonsils with success.
Bob Bartlett,doctors,"If they take their children to doctors, they believe they are putting their faith in man instead of in God."
Luis Bunuel,doctors,"In the name of Hypocrites, doctors have invented the most exquisite form of torture ever known to man: survival."
Gabriel Garcia Marquez,doctors,Injections are the best thing ever invented for feeding doctors.
Florence Nightingale,doctors,"Instead of wishing to see more doctors made by women joining what there are, I wish to see as few doctors, either male or female, as possible. For, mark you, the women have made no improvement - they have only tried to be ''men'' and they have only succeeded in being third-rate men."
Bernie Siegel,doctors,"Mind-body medicine should not be an 'alternative,' nor should complementary and integrative medicine be something doctors are not exposed to during their training."

Rebecca West,doctors,She saw she had fallen into the hands of one of those doctors who have strayed too far from apparent in the direction of the soul.

Jonathan Swift,doctors,"The best doctors in the world are Doctor Diet, Doctor Quiet, and Doctor Merryman."

Ba Jin,doctors,"The doctors realized very clearly that their minds and emotions were changing from day to day. On the one hand they were healing the patient, and on the other it looked as if they were healing themselves too. It was this chief surgeon who first volunteered to offer his skin when grafting began."
Billy Barty,doctors,"The general public thinks all little people are in circuses or sideshows. We have doctors, nurses, just about every field covered."

George Bernard Shaw,doctors,The test to which all methods of treatment are finally brought is whether they are lucrative to doctors or not.
Bernie Siegel,doctors,"The thing you see in survivors is that they express feelings - I won't say some of the things they tell their doctors, when doctors tell them they're going to die in six months. Boy, do they let the doctor know how they feel about that statement."
Barry Ritholtz,doctors,"There is a shortage of doctors, and the American Medical Association is aiming to keep it that way."
Bernie Siegel,doctors,"There is survival behavior, and doctors need to learn from patients who do not die when they are supposed to, instead of saying, 'You're doing very well, so keep doing whatever you are doing.' They should be asking what their patient is doing and pass the information to other patients."
Bernadine Dohrn,doctors,"Today enormous effort goes into convincing the American public that we're just consumers of media manipulation and sound-bites and spin doctors. That we care only about ourselves, money, and stuff. That acting out of passion and conviction doesn't make a difference. But all history shows that it does."
Betty Shabazz,doctors,Two young doctors - one from Harvard and the other from Dartmouth - invited me to go to Mecca in my husband's stead. And that is what helped put me back on track.

Bennet Omalu,doctors,"What I did when I identified Mike Webster's thing, I showed it to other doctors. We all agreed that this was something new, but we had to give it a name. This was not dementia pugilistica. Maybe we could have called it dementia footballitica!"
Bobby Seale,doctors,"When donors visited the Black Panther Party, they came and saw our real programs, a real clinic, with real doctors and medics, giving service to people."
Alexander Pope,doctors,"Who shall decide when doctors disagree, And soundest casuists doubt, like you and me?"
Bennet Omalu,doctors,"Yes, the concept that blunt-force trauma of the head causes brain damage is a generally accepted principle of medicine. That is why I was so appalled by the NFL doctors who were denying my work."

Oscar Wilde,doubt,"A man's very highest moment is, I have no doubt at all, when he kneels in the dust, and beats his breast, and tells all the sins of his life."
Carl Jung,doubt,"All ages before ours believed in gods in some form or other. Only an unparalleled impoverishment in symbolism could enable us to rediscover the gods as psychic factors, which is to say, as archetypes of the unconscious. No doubt this discovery is hardly credible as yet."
Marcus Tullius Cicero,doubt,"All pain is either severe or slight, if slight, it is easily endured; if severe, it will without doubt be brief."
Marquis de Sade,doubt,"All, all is theft, all is unceasing and rigorous competition in nature; the desire to make off with the substance of others is the foremost - the most legitimate - passion nature has bred into us and, without doubt, the most agreeable one."
Henry Thomas Buckle,doubt,"An accurate observer is, no doubt, rare; but an accurate thinker is far rarer."
Antonio Tabucchi,doubt,"An intellectual is going to have doubts, for example, about a fundamentalist religious doctrine that admits no doubt, about an imposed political system that allows no doubt, about a perfect aesthetic that has no room for doubt."

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,doubt,Any truth is better than indefinite doubt.
Arlen Specter,doubt,"As I think through the issue of funding the rebuilding of Iraq, I think about the analogy of a bankruptcy proceeding. There is no doubt that Iraq as a country is bankrupt."
B. Carroll Reece,doubt,"As the egalitarianism of Marxism is attractive to many, socialism could have attracted many followers in America, anyway. But there is no doubt that it could not possibly have affected us so widely and so deeply as it has, had it not been heavily financed."
Mark Twain,doubt,"As to the adjective, when in doubt strike it out."
Armstrong Williams,doubt,"At the end of the day, there is no doubt that the unique spirit embodied by this country has worked, not just to make the world safer, but to make it better."

Brad Garrett,doubt,Broadway was without doubt the hardest I ever worked in my life and the highest highs I've ever had as an actor. The unadulterated fear was on a level that was hard to explain.
Gilbert K. Chesterton,doubt,"Buddhism is not a creed, it is a doubt."
Baruch Spinoza,doubt,"But if men would give heed to the nature of substance they would doubt less concerning the Proposition that Existence appertains to the nature of substance: rather they would reckon it an axiom above all others, and hold it among common opinions. For then by substance they would understand that which is in itself, and through itself is conceived, or rather that whose knowledge does not depend on the knowledge of any other thing."
Bret Harte,doubt,"But still when the mists of doubt prevail, And we lie becalmed by the shores of age, We hear from the misty troubled shore The voce of children gone before. Drawing the soul to its anchorage."

Carl Jung,doubt,"Caution has its place, no doubt, but we cannot refuse our support to a serious venture which challenges the whole of the personality. If we oppose it, we are trying to suppress what is best in man -his daring and his aspirations. And should we succeed, we should only have stood in the way of that invaluable experience which might have given a meaning to life. What would have happened if Paul had allowed himself to be talked out of his journey to Damascus?"
Berkeley Breathed,doubt,"Dear Lord, I've been asked, nay commanded, to thank Thee for the Christmas turkey before us... a turkey which was no doubt a lively, intelligent bird... a social being... capable of actual affection... nuzzling its young with almost human-like compassion. Anyway, it's dead and we're gonna eat it. Please give our respects to its family."

Doubt truth to be a liar;,

Marcia Wieder,doubt,"Focus more on your desire than on your doubt, and the dream will take care of itself. You may be surprised at how easily this happens. Your doubts are not as powerful as your desires, unless you make them so."

Bergen Evans,doubt,Freedom of speech and freedom of action are meaningless without freedom to think. And there is no freedom of thought without doubt.

Antonio Tabucchi,doubt,"I don't have any doubts either about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Perhaps some more should be added to the list, but I don't have the slightest doubt about human rights."
Desiderius Erasmus,doubt,I doubt if a single individual could be found from the whole of mankind free from some form of insanity. The only difference is one of degree. A man who sees a gourd and takes it for his wife is called insane because this happens to very few people.

George Orwell,doubt,I doubt whether classical education ever has been or can be successfully carried out without corporal punishment.
Burning Spear,doubt,"I feel that no one should be ashamed or have fear or doubt within themselves when they speak about the roots or Africa wherein I and I originate from. It's like an individual who tries to disown himself, and to me, it is a form of defeat by disowning yourself."
Henry David Thoreau,doubt,"I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized."
E. F. Schumacher,doubt,"I have no doubt that it is possible to give a new direction to technological development, a direction that shall lead it back to the real needs of man, and that also means: to the actual size of man.

Anne Rice,doubt,"I'm definitely more influenced by European writers than I am by American writers, there's no doubt about that."
Richard Dawkins,doubt,"I'm sure Obama is an atheist; I'm sure Kennedy was an atheist, but I doubt if Pope Frank is."
Ben Carson,doubt,I've had experiences in my life that leave no doubt in my mind about the fact that God exists. I'm quite willing to debate people who don't think so because I want them to explain to me how did our solar system get so organized and how is the universe so complex and yet well-organized that we can predict 70 years hence when a comet is coming?
Anais Nin,doubt,"I, with a deeper instinct, choose a man who compels my strength, who makes enormous demands on me, who does not doubt my courage or my toughness, who does not believe me naive or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman."

A. N. Wilson,doubt,"It would no doubt be very sentimental to argue - but I would argue it nevertheless - that the peculiar combination of joy and sadness in bell music - both of clock chimes, and of change-ringing - is very typical of England. It is of a piece with the irony in which English people habitually address one another."
Antonio Tabucchi,doubt,It's the job of intellectuals and writers to cast doubt on perfection.
Bob Newhart,doubt,"Jack Benny was, without a doubt, the bravest comedian I have ever seen work. He wasn't afraid of silence. He would take as long as it took to tell the story."

Thomas Szasz,doubt,Knowledge is gained by learning; trust by doubt; skill by practice; love by love.

G. C. Lichtenberg,doubt,Of all the inventions of man I doubt whether any was more easily accomplished than that of a Heaven.
Barbara Deming,doubt,"Of course it can be said of jails, too, that they try - by punishing the troublesome - to deter others. No doubt, in certain instances this deterrence actually works. But generally speaking it fails conspicuously."
Oscar Wilde,doubt,"One can only give an unbiased opinion about things that do not interest one, which is no doubt the reason an unbiased opinion is always valueless. The man who sees both sides of a question is a man who sees absolutely nothing."
Bill Viola,doubt,One of the most important things for me in terms of my working method is doubt. I get very insecure about my ideas. And I don't say 'insecure' in kind of a paranoid way. I mean just: 'Are they good enough?' 'Is this the right thing to do?' I really beat myself up over that.
Henry James,doubt,"Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task."
Clark Kenneth,doubt,"People sometimes tell me that they prefer barbarism to civilization. I doubt if they have given it a long enough trial. Like the people of Alexandria, they are bored by civilization; but all the evidence suggests that the boredom of barbarism is infinitely greater."

Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,doubt,"The greater the knowledge, the greater the doubt."
Nathaniel Hawthorne,doubt,"The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom, to know when it ought to be resisted, and when it be obeyed."
Jean Rostand,doubt,"The ideal, without doubt, varies, but its enemies, alas, are always the same."

Arnold Bennett,doubt,"There can be no doubt that the average man blames much more than he praises. His instinct is to blame. If he is satisfied he says nothing; if he is not, he most illogically kicks up a row."
Kofi Annan,doubt,"There can be no doubt that these attacks are deliberate acts of terrorism, carefully planned and coordinated  and as such I condemn them utterly. Terrorism must be fought resolutely wherever it appears."

Arthur Erickson,doubt,There is little doubt that we are in the midst of a revolution of a much more profound and fundamental nature than the social and political revolutions of the last half century.
S. Maxwell Coder,doubt,"There is no doubt that God has often brought a certain verse to the attention of one of His children in an unusual and almost miraculous manner, for a special need, but the Word was never intended to be consulted in a superstitious manner."

Bob Hawke,doubt,"There is no doubt that this government and this country are benefiting from the reforms that we brought in the 1980s, and that couldn't have been done without the co-operation of the trade union movement."
Bjorn Lomborg,doubt,"There is no doubt that we should take solar radiation into account. We have seen ground temperatures rising since 1975, and it is important to know to what extent that has been caused by the sun or by carbon dioxide."
A. N. Wilson,doubt,"There is no doubt that, since 1977 and the launch of Apple II - the first computer it produced for the mass market - many things which used to be done on paper, or on the telephone, have been done easier and faster on a screen."
Buddha,doubt,There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt. Doubt separates people. It is a poison that disintegrates friendships and breaks up pleasant relations. It is a thorn that irritates and hurts; it is a sword that kills.

Carl Jung,doubt,"Unfortunately, there can be no doubt that man is, on the whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and darker it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it. Furthermore, it is constantly in contact with other interests, so that it is continually subjected to modifications. But if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness, it never gets co"

Bruce Babbitt,economy,"The notion that big business and big labor and big government can sit down around a table somewhere and work out the direction of the American economy is at complete variance with the reality of where the American economy is headed.

Bev Perdue,economy,"We can go back to economic plans that are only designed to benefit the wealthiest among us, like Mitt Romney.

Bradley A. Smith,effort,"Every major federal campaign-finance-reform effort since 1943 has attempted to treat corporations and unions equally. If a limit applied to corporations, it applied to unions; if unions could form PACs, corporations could too; and so on. DISCLOSE is the first major campaign-finance bill that has not taken this approach."
Alexis Carrel,effort,Everyone makes a greater effort to hurt other people than to help himself.

Erich Fromm,effort,Greed is a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction.

Mahatma Gandhi,effort,"I claim to be an average man of less than average ability. I have not the shadow of a doubt that any man or woman can achieve what I have, if he or she would make the same effort and cultivate the same hope and faith."
Angela Merkel,effort,"I feel sorry sometimes for these sportsmen and women who put in just as much effort as the footballers. For example, athletes train at least as hard as footballers but have to be happy if they can earn enough to finance a decent education."

Theodore Roosevelt,effort,"It is only through labor and painful effort, by grim energy and resolute courage, that we move on to better things."
Balthazar Getty,effort,"It's been such a group effort. When you're a new band and you have limited resources, you end up getting people that are there because they love what you do, and that's great."
Bill Hicks,effort,"It's just a ride and we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money, a choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one."

Anais Nin,effort,Living never wore one out so much as the effort not to live.
Quentin Crisp,effort,"Love is the extra effort we make in our dealings with those whom we do not like and once you understand that, you understand all. This idea that love overtakes you is nonsense. This is but a polite manifestation of sex. To love another you have to undertake some fragment of their destiny."
Blaise Pascal,effort,"Man finds nothing so intolerable as to be in a state of complete rest, without passions, without occupation, without diversion, without effort. Then he feels his nullity, loneliness, inadequacy, dependence, helplessness, emptiness."

Aldous Huxley,effort,Most of one's life is one prolonged effort to prevent oneself thinking.

Ban Ki-moon,effort,"My U.N. five-point plan focuses on preventing proliferation, strengthening the legal regime, and ensuring nuclear safety and security - an effort that was given good momentum by the Nuclear Security Summit held in Seoul earlier this year. The world is over-armed, and peace is underfunded."
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,effort,"My whole effort here is to keep you as non-serious as possible, for the simple reason that meditation, all kinds of meditation, can make you too serious and that seriousness will create a spiritual disease and nothing else.

Benjamin Tucker,effort,"One thing, however, is sure, - that in all cases the effort should be to impose all the cost of repairing the wrong upon the doer of the wrong. This alone is real justice, and of course such justice is necessarily free."
T. S. Eliot,effort,Our emotions are only ''incidents in the effort to keep day and night together.
Al Goldstein,effort,Our photographs are filthier and our stories are more disgusting. We make no effort to be artistic.
Calvin Coolidge,effort,"Parties do not maintain themselves. They are maintained by effort. The government is not self-existent. It is maintained by the effort of those who believe in it. The people of America believe in American institutions, the American form of government and the American method of transacting business."
Albert Ellis,effort,People could rationally decide that prolonged relationships take up too much time and effort and that they'd much rather do other kinds of things. But most people are afraid of rejection.
Caroline Glick,effort,"Perhaps the central reason that Ahmadinejad's message, and the hundreds of thousands of voices echoing his call throughout the world, are so dangerous is because the Free World is making precious little effort to assert its own message."
Abba Eban,effort,Playing the game I have learned the meaning of humility. It has given me an understanding of futility of the human effort.
Mahatma Gandhi,effort,"Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment, full effort is full victory.,
"
Emma Goldman,effort,"Since every effort in our educational life seems to be directed toward making of the child a being foreign to itself, it must of necessity produce individuals foreign to one another, and in everlasting antagonism with each other."
William Howard Taft,effort,"Socialism proposes no adequate substitute for the motive of enlightened selfishness that to-day is at the basis of all human labor and effort, enterprise and new activity."

Hitopadesa,effort,"Subdue fate by exerting human strength to the maximum; and if, when the effort has been made and success is not achieved, no one else can be blamed."

Vince Lombardi,effort,The achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual.
Marilyn Ferguson,effort,"The brain's calculations do not require our conscious effort, only our attention and our openness to let the information through. Although the brain absorbs universes of information, little is admitted into normal consciousness."
Max Lerner,effort,"The crime of book purging is that it involves a rejection of the word. For the word is never absolute truth, but only man's frail and human effort to approach the truth. To reject the word is to reject the human search."
George Santayana,effort,"The effort of art is to keep what is interesting in existence, to recreate it in the eternal."
Walter Lippmann,effort,The effort to calculate exactly what the voters want at each particular moment leaves out of account the fact that when they are troubled the thing the voters most want is to be told what to want.
Steven Weinberg,effort,"The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of tragedy."
John Fischer,effort,"The essence of our effort to see that every child has a chance must be to assure each an equal opportunity, not to become equal, but to become different- to realize whatever unique potential of body, mind and spirit he or she possesses."
Anna Garlin Spencer,effort,The failure of women to produce genius of the first rank in most of the supreme forms of human effort has been used to block the way of all women of talent and ambition for intellectual achievement.
Andy Rooney,effort,"The federal government has sponsored research that has produced a tomato that is perfect in every respect, except that you can't eat it. We should make every effort to make sure this disease, often referred to as 'progress', doesn't spread."
Colin Powell,effort,The healthiest competition occurs when average people win by putting above average effort.
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,effort,The history of all countries shows that the working class exclusively by its own effort is able to develop only trade-union consciousness.
Hannah Arendt,effort,"The human condition is such that pain and effort are not just symptoms which can be removed without changing life itself; they are the modes in which life itself, together with the necessity to which it is bound, makes itself felt. For mortals, the ''easy life of the gods'' would be a lifeless life."

Napoleon Hill,effort,The possibilities of creative effort connected with the subconscious mind are stupendous and imponderable. They inspire one with awe.
Deepak Chopra,effort,The possibility of stepping into a higher plane is quite real for everyone. It requires no force or effort or sacrifice. It involves little more than changing our ideas about what is normal.

Bill Dedman,effort,The scientific effort to inform the public about landslide risks often runs head-on into powerful economic interests.

Bernice Johnson Reagon,effort,"The Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife, actually, was an effort to put something on the mall in Washington so American tourists could walk through America, and in their minds everything on the mall would be American."

Henry Louis Mencken,effort,Theology is the effort to explain the unknowable in terms of the not worth knowing.
Liu Shao-Ch'I,effort,"There is no such thing as a perfect leader either in the past or present, in China or elsewhere. If there is one, he is only pretending, like a pig inserting scallions into its nose in an effort to look like an elephant."

Zig Ziglar,effort,"This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward."
Bill Rancic,effort,"This was our last stop. This was it. We had those two embryos that we had banked prior to learning about the breast cancer, and with the medicine she was on, this was our last effort. The prayers were answered."
Bill Hicks,effort,"Those guys were in hog heaven, man. They had a weapons catalog, What's G-12 do, Tommy? Says here it destroys everything but the fillings in their teeth, helps pay for the war effort. Well, shit, pull that one up! Pull up G-12, please. ] ...Cool. What's G-13 do?"
Ban Ki-moon,effort,"Throughout human history, in any great endeavour requiring the common effort of many nations and men and women everywhere, we have learned - it is only through seriousness of purpose and persistence that we ultimately carry the day.

Mark Van Doren,effort,"To be what no one ever was, to be what everyone has been: Freedom is the mean of those extremes that fence all effort in."
Friedrich Nietzsche,effort,To exercise power costs effort and demands courage. That is why so many fail to assert rights to which they are perfectly entitled - because a right is a kind of power but they are too lazy or too cowardly to exercise it. The virtues which cloak these faults are called patience and forbearance.
David Viscott,effort,"To fail is a natural consequence of trying, To succeed takes time and prolonged effort in the face of unfriendly odds. To think it will be any other way, no matter what you do, is to invite yourself to be hurt and to limit your enthusiasm for trying again."
Sir William Osler,effort,"To have striven, to have made the effort, to have been true to certain ideals - this alone is worth the struggle."
Phillips Brooks,effort,"To say, ''well done'' to any bit of good work is to take hold of the powers which have made the effort and strengthen them beyond our knowledge."
Augustus William Hare,effort,"To talk without effort is, after all, the great charm of talking."
Bernadine Dohrn,effort,"Today enormous effort goes into convincing the American public that we're just consumers of media manipulation and sound-bites and spin doctors. That we care only about ourselves, money, and stuff. That acting out of passion and conviction doesn't make a difference. But all history shows that it does."

Jesse Owens,effort,"We all have dreams. But in order to make dreams come into reality, it takes an awful lot of determination, dedication, self-discipline, and effort."
William James,effort,"We forget that every good that is worth possessing must be paid for in strokes of daily effort. We postpone and postpone, until those smiling possibilities are dead."

Enrique Jardiel Poncela,effort,"When something can be read without effort, great effort has gone into its writing."

James Baldwin,effort,"Words like ''freedom,'' ''justice,'' ''democracy'' are not common concepts; on the contrary, they are rare. People are not born knowing what these are. It takes enormous and, above all, individual effort to arrive at the respect for other people that these words imply."

Bill Kristol,elections,"The average GOP presidential vote in these last five elections was 44.5 percent. In the last three, it was 48.1 percent. Give Romney an extra point for voter disillusionment with Obama, and a half-point for being better financed than his predecessors. It still strikes me as a path to narrow defeat."
Barbara Lee,elections,The last two elections were stolen. They were stolen and so we will not rest until we reclaim our democracy and this is what today is all about.

John Quincy Adams,elections,Where annual elections end where slavery begins.
Bradley A. Smith,elections,"With super PACs, we've seen voter turnout go up; interest in elections rise; and the number of competitive races increase. The campaigns of 2010 and 2012 have been more issue-oriented than their predecessors, not less."

Bipasha Basu,love,"Any relationship should have love, and if there is no love, it is better to call off a relationship.

Bernie Siegel,love,"Being a survivor doesn't mean being strong - it's telling people when you need a meal or a ride, company, whatever.

Rose Macaulay,love,"Cranks live by theory, not by pure desire. They want votes, peace, nuts, liberty, and spinning-looms not because they love these things, as a child loves jam, but because they think they ought to have them. That is one element which makes the crank."
Alice Walker,love,Criticism is painful when it's not done with love.

Betsy Brandt,love,"Everybody - even huge movie stars - have downs. That's just how it is. The work ebbs and flows. My manager and I were saying, 'Let's remember that in 2013 we were soooo busy.'

Jean Cocteau,love,"Everything one does in life, even love, occurs in an express train racing toward death. To smoke opium is to get out of the train while it is still moving. It is to concern oneself with something other than life or death."

Bernie Siegel,love,"Feelings aroused by the touch of someone's hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith - all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well."

John Gay,love,Fill it up. I take as large draughts of liquor as I did of love. I hate a flincher in either.
Bipasha Basu,love,"Films with female protagonists don't attract many eyeballs. Most of them are perceived as feminist films.

Erica Jong,love,"Growing up female in America. What a liability!

Anne Brontë,love,"He despises me, because he knows I love him."

Martin Luther King,love,"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. That is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant."
Martina Navratilova,love,I came to live in a country I love; some people label me a defector. I have loved men and women in my life; I've been labeled ''the bisexual defector'' in print. Want to know another secret? I'm even ambidextrous. I don't like labels. Just call me Martina.
Erica Jong,love,"I can live without it all - love with its blood pump, sex with its messy hungers, men with their peacock strutting, their silly sexual baggage, their wet tongues in my ear."
Judy Garland,love,"I can live without money, but I cannot live without love."
Alban Berg,love,"I can tell you, dearest friend, that if it became known how much friendship, love and a world of human and spiritual references I have smuggled into these three movements, the adherents of programme music - should there be any left - would go mad with joy."
Augusten Burroughs,love,"I can't tell you how much I love Target and Costco, that kind of culture, because it's something I never felt a part of. I've always felt like a tourist because I have never fit in anywhere."
Anne Brontë,love,I cannot love a man who cannot protect me.
Carl Gustav Jung,love,"I cannot love anyone if I hate myself. That is the reason why we feel so extremely uncomfortable in the presence of people who are noted for their special virtuousness, for they radiate an atmosphere of the torture they inflict on themselves. That is not a virtue but a vice."
Ann Beattie,love,"I could name a few songs and say exactly what summer they came out and what boy I thought I was in love with when I was fourteen years old, but I think that music used to be really more a part of the culture when people went out dancing in a different way than they do now."
Bruno Mars,love,"I could sing you a thousand and one doo-wop songs. I love the simplicity in that music. It's not super-poetic, it's just from the heart."
George Michael,love,"I define my sexuality in terms of the people that I love.,
"
Zora Neale Hurston,love,I did not just fall in love. I made a parachute jump.
Adam Sandler,love,I do love the films I've done in the past. I work hard in my movies and my friends work hard and we're trying to make people laugh and I'm very proud of that.
Anne Morrow Lindbergh,love,"I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness and the willingness to remain vulnerable."
Anthony Trollope,love,"I do not know whether there be, as a rule, more vocal expression of the sentiment of love between a man and a woman, than there is between two thrushes. They whistle and call to each other, guided by instinct rather than by reason."
Oliver Goldsmith,love,I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing.
John Lennon,love,"I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love."
Brooke Burke,love,"I don't get stage fright, I actually love the energy, I love the spontaneity, I love the adrenaline you get in front of a live audience, it actually really works for me."

Zelda Fitzgerald,love,"I don't want to live - I want to love first, and live incidentally."

John Keats,love,I equally dislike the favor of the public with the love of a woman - they are both a cloying treacle to the wings of independence.
Arthur Godfrey,love,"I explained to the lady my love for John and his work, and she made it possible for me to purchase one of the 24 proofs, the one for 'I'm So Tired,' which I have on my piano at home."
Amy Winehouse,love,"I fall in love every day. Not with people but with situations.,

Marianne Williamson,love,"I fell in love with the thought that a human life could be a priestly conduit, a connecting link between earth and sky. As I grew and stumbled and, most important, as I began to love and be loved, I realized that the ultimate priest is the lover inside us"
Benazir Bhutto,love,"I find that whenever I am in power, or my father was in power, somehow good things happen. The economy picks up, we have good rains, water comes, people have crops. I think the reason this happens is that we want to give love and we receive love."
Bryan Batt,love,"I firmly believe that life is an 'and' proposition and not an 'or' one. If you really love something, you just have to try it. The worse that can happen is that you'll be told 'no.'"
Antony Hewish,love,"I grew up in Newquay, on the Atlantic coast and there developed a love of the sea and boats."
Albert Ellis,love,I had a great many sex and love cases where people were absolutely devastated when somebody with whom they were compulsively in love didn't love them back. They were killing themselves with anxiety and depression.
Bruce Forsyth,love,"I hate the term 'arm candy.' But, look, a woman's figure is a beautiful thing, and if she has shapely legs, then she should show them off, because men love to see that. Not just heterosexual men - gay men like to see a woman in her beauty and the shape of her."
Jimmy Connors,love,I hate to lose more than I love to win.
August Strindberg,love,I hated her now with a hatred more fatal than indifference because it was the other side of love.
Orson Welles,love,"I have a great love and respect for religion, great love and respect for atheism. What I hate is agnosticism, people who do not choose."
Leo Buscaglia,love,I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate - it's apathy. It's not giving a damn.
Germaine Greer,love,I have always been principally interested in men for sex. I've always thought any sane woman would be a lover of women because loving men is such a mess. I have always wished I'd fall in love with a woman. Damn.
Lord George Byron,love,I have always laid it down as a maxim - and found it justified by experience - that a man and a woman make far better friendships than can exist between two of the same sex - but then with the condition that they never have made or are to make love to each other.
John Keats,love,I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion - I have shuddered at it. I shudder no more - I could be martyred for my religion - Love is my religion - I could die for that.
Martin Luther King,love,I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.
Edward VIII,love,"I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love. I now quit altogether public affairs, and I lay down my burden."

St. Augustine of Hippo,love,"I have learnt to love you late, Beauty at once so ancient and so new!"

George Michael,love,"I have more love, success, and security than I could ever dream of.,
"
Astrid Lindgren,love,"I have never experienced being madly in love the way most people seem to have been, although it is not something I would miss. Instead I have had an enormous ability to love my children and my grandchildren and my great grandchildren."
Michelangelo,love,I have never felt salvation in nature. I love cities above all.
Bruce Vilanch,love,"I have one rave 'New York Times' review framed next to a flop 'Los Angeles Times' review. And it's for the same show. These people watched the same show. That's what happens. They love it, they hate it."
Anne Sullivan,love,"I have thought about it a great deal, and the more I think, the more certain I am that obedience is the gateway through which knowledge, yes, and love, too, enter the mind of the child."
Nicolas Chamfort,love,"I have three kinds of friends: those who love me, those who pay no attention to me, and those who detest me."
Abdul Qadeer Khan,love,"I have to ask Allah's forgiveness and not get angry, because they come to me out of love, and it's not fitting that I should turn to them in hatred."
Bruce Sterling,love,"I haven't had that good a time in ages. Since September 11, really. I just felt so happy, it was like the sun came out of the clouds for me. I love Italy."
Henry James,love,I hold any writer sufficiently justified who is himself in love with his theme.
Charles Dickens,love,I hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any evil or misfortune in the world.

Samuel Beckett,love,"I just love the idea that people disappear into the story for a while.,
"

Mary Wortley Montagu,love,"I know a love may be revived which absence, inconstancy, or even infidelity has extinguished, but there is no returning from a dégoût given by satiety."
Burn Gorman,love,"I know in Britain with 'Doctor Who' all the classic actors, and the people who you'd really want to, work on the show. I like that the fact that 'Torchwood' has actors that want to be involved from the stage. It has raised our game, and I'm just happy for good actors who want to be in sci-fi shows who love the genre."
Diana Spencer Princess of Wales,love,"I know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour; for a day, for a month, but I can give and I'm very happy to do that and I want to do that."
Georges Bernanos,love,"I know the compassion of others is a relief at first. I don't despise it. But it can't quench pain, it slips through your soul as through a sieve. And when our suffering has been dragged from one pity to another, as from one mouth to another, we can no longer respect or love it."
Ray Bradbury,love,"I know you've heard it a thousand times before. But it's true - hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don't love something, then don't do it."

Bob Dylan,love,"I like America, just as everybody else does. I love America, I gotta say that. But America will be judged."
Brooke Burke,love,"I like feet. I definitely have a fetish. I love to see a man's bare foot, but its got to be taken care of. If they're not well manicured, you've got to wonder what the rest of him is like. I don't want to get in bed with somebody and feel his gnarly feet."
Jerome K. Jerome,love,I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours. I love to keep it by me; the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.
Alex Haley,love,"I look at my books the way parents look at their children. The fact that one becomes more successful than the others doesn't make me love the less successful one any less.,
,
"
Bhagavad Gita,love,"I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me, and I come to life in them."

Oscar Wilde,love,I love acting. It is so much more real than life.
Bryan Fuller,love,"I love actors, and I love the casting process. It's funny, like, some writers don't like actors because, I think, they are the faces of the show, and so you feel sort of secondary, but I love actors because they elevate the material; they make it better."

Douglas Adams,love,"I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.,
,
"
Peggy Noonan,love,"I love eulogies. They are the most moving kind of speech because they attempt to pluck meaning from the fog, and on short order, when the emotions are still ragged and raw and susceptible to leaps."
Oliver Goldsmith,love,"I love everything that's old: old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wines; and, I believe, Dorothy, you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife."
Bryan Singer,love,"I love filmmaking, and I love the process. And I would rather do nothing else. It's a privilege to be able to paint such big pictures, so to speak."

,
"
Bryan Fuller,love,"I love horror, fantasy and sci-fi. Those are my genres of love and devotion."
David Herbert Lawrence,love,"I love Italian opera - it's so reckless. Damn Wagner, and his bellowings at Fate and death. Damn Debussy, and his averted face. I like the Italians who run all on impulse, and don't care about their immortal souls, and don't worry about the ultimate."

Alanis Morissette,love,I love songs that are very autobiographical.
Bruno Mars,love,"I love that I can talk to my fans through Twitter, to cut out the middle man. Because I've done interviews where my words have gotten twisted, so it's nice to be able to have things coming straight from me."
Nancy Lopez,love,I love the challenge.

Augusten Burroughs,love,I love to both give and receive very old books.
Ann Coulter,love,I love to engage in repartee with people who are stupider than I am.

Diana Spencer Princess of Wales,love,"I love to hold people's hands when I visit hospitals, even though they are shocked because they haven't experienced anything like it before, but to me it is a normal thing to do."

Bob Saget,love,"I really love making people laugh.,
"
Brigitte Bardot,love,"I really wanted to die at certain periods in my life. Death was like love, a romantic escape. I took pills because I didn't want to throw myself off my balcony and know people would photograph me lying dead below."
David Bissonette,love,I recently read that love is entirely a matter of chemistry. That must be why my wife treats me like toxic waste.
George Sand,love,"I regard as a mortal sin not only the lying of the senses in matters of love, but also the illusion which the senses seek to create where love is only partial. I say, I believe, that one must love with all of one's being, or else live, come what may, a life of complete chastity."

Brooke Elliott,love,"I think a lot of times we're so told in our world that marriage is everything, and having a partner is everything. If you look at our movies and things, it's all directed around that love, and if you don't have that love, how sad you are."

Adam Arkin,love,"I want to continue doing as big a variety of things as I can do, and if that means I have the honor of getting to do more feature work, I would love that. I know that if I make any other long-term TV commitments, it's not going to be on a drama."

Anne Rice,love,I wish we had more visible Christian and Catholic leaders who talked about love.
Nathaniel Hawthorne,love,"I wonder that we Americans love our country at all, it having no limits and no oneness; and when you try to make it a matter of the heart, everything falls away except one's native State; -neither can you seize hold of that, unless you tear it out of the Union, bleeding and quivering."

Bill Engvall,love,"I'd like to see the Amazon rainforests before they're all gone, and also the Galapagos - that's another one I'd like to do. I'd love to go diving in those areas. Basically, places, like, that are kind of going away, and I'd like to see them before they all become condos and high-rises."
Bryan Ferry,love,I'd love to follow the Tour de France one day. It's a really exciting spectacle. I've only seen it once as it was coming into Paris and that was very exciting for me. I have memories of that.
Bill Goldberg,love,"I'd love to get back in the ring so my son could see me, but that's it."
Bellamy Young,love,I'd love to go back and do theater. There's nothing like that instant response and the connection to a live audience.

Brooke Elliott,love,"I'd love to go back to Broadway; I'd love to do animation; I'd love to do hair and make-up campaigns because I love hair and makeup - and, I'd love to do film. I mean, there are a lot of doors I'd love to open up!"

I love how the garden grows , And I love the garden rose."
Aaron Spelling,love,"I'll tell you what I miss most. What I would love to do, more than anything, is just anthologies. With an anthology you can tell any story and be in every division of television. We don't have any anthologies anymore, do we?"

Beyonce Knowles,love,I'm a human being and I fall in love and sometimes I don't have control of every situation.
Bianca Lawson,love,"I'm a pretty low key person when it comes to style, I love to be comfortable all the time. I love getting dressed up when I'm going out. But most of the time, I just like to be comfortable. It's really annoying to everyone in my life, but I love it."

Alain de Botton,love,I'm also interested in the modern suggestion that you can have a combination of love and sex in a marriage - which no previous society has ever believed.
Ben Marcus,love,"I'm attracted to how fraught the parent-child relationship is, swerving so easily between love and hostility, with almost no plausible way to end, unless someone dies."
Bryan Batt,love,"I'm in love with red. I think it's such a passionate color. Every flag of every country pretty much has red it it. It's power, there's no fence sitting with red. Either you love it or you don't. I think its blood and strength and life. I do love red. I love all colors. Great shades of blue, you find them in nature. They're all magic."
Alan Alda,love,"I'm in the real world, some people try to steal from me, and I stop them, frequently, take them to court. I love a good lawsuit. It's fun."

Anne Michaels,love,"I'm naive enough to think that love is always good no matter how long ago, no matter the circumstances."
Bill Hader,love,"I'm never going to say, 'Well, I'm never going to do comedy again.' I love comedies, and it's what people know me for, so I love doing it... I don't really think about it in terms of 'Well, I should do this because it's comedy or drama.'"
Bella Thorne,love,"I'm really into tall boots. I just got some new ones from Michael Kors that have these little gold studs. I have Valentino ones that I really love. Real, real tall boots!"

Burning Spear,love,"I've been singing about love a long time now, because my kind of love carries a different flavor. My lyrics are not so outrageous as some. You have to think about a lot of different things. You get more mature with what you do - more experience, more capable, you know, the older you get."
Billie Holiday,love,I've been told that nobody sings the word hunger like I do. Or the word love.

Bill Paxton,love,"I've had a career that is kind of under the radar, but it sure is varied, and I've been so blessed to be able to get paid to do something I love to do."
Betty Wright,love,"I've just learned that love is a very fleeting thing, so we - then we have it; we need to hold on to it but hold on to it in a gracious fashion. Not in the smothering but more so just a covering kind of love."
Barry Eisler,love,I've loved thrillers and spy stories since I was a kid. It's probably not a bad rule of thumb to write the kinds of stories you love to read.

Caroline Wozniacki,love,"If I didn't love tennis, I wouldn't be playing. That's also why I don't know how long I will be playing because if I start feeling like this is not what I want to do anymore, that there's not really any reason anymore."
Byron Katie,love,"If I had a prayer, it would be this: God spare me from the desire for love, approval, and appreciation. Amen."

Beyonce Knowles,love,"If I weren't performing, I'd be a beauty editor or a therapist. I love creativity, but I also love to help others. My mother was a hairstylist, and they listen to everyone's problems - like a beauty therapist!"
Belle Boyd,love,"If it is a crime to love the South, its cause and its President, then I am a criminal. I would rather lie down in this prison and die than leave it owing allegiance to a government such as yours."
Boris Pasternak,love,"If it is so painful to love and to be charged with this electric current, how much more painful must it be to a woman and to be the current, and to inspire love."
Lily Tomlin,love,"If love is the answer, could you please rephrase the question?"
Ann Oakley,love,"If love means that one person absorbs the other, then no real relationship exists any more. Love evaporates; there is nothing left to love. The integrity of self is gone."

William Shakespeare,love,"If music be the food of love, play on."
Babyface,love,"If my life depended on being a social-media person in terms of talking myself up, I probably would be in trouble because - not that I wouldn't be able to step up to it - but I wouldn't love it. I wouldn't want to be that person; that wouldn't be my natural thing."
Brigitte Bardot,love,"If only every man who sees my films did not get the impression he can make love to me, I would be a lot happier."
Katherine Mansfield,love,If only one could tell true love from false love as one can tell mushrooms from toadstools.
Ben Elton,love,If only the strength of the love that people feel when it is reciprocated could be as intense and obsessive as the love we feel when it is not; then marriages would be truly made in heaven.
Carl Jung,love,"If people can be educated to see the lowly side of their own natures, it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and to love their fellow men better. A little less hypocrisy and a little more tolerance towards oneself can only have good results in respect for our neighbor; for we are all too prone to transfer to our fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures."
Kurt Vonnegut Jr,love,"If somebody says, ''I love you,'' to me, I feel as though I had a pistol pointed at my head. What can anybody reply under such conditions but that which the pistol-holder requires? ''I love you, too. ''"
John Lennon,love,"If someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the Sixties, that's his problem. Love and peace are eternal.,

Francis Quarles,love,"If thou desire the love of God and man, be humble, for the proud heart, as it loves none but itself, is beloved of none but itself. Humility enforces where neither virtue, nor strength, nor reason can prevail."

What you hope for doesn't matter, but rather the essence of hope itself."
Ray Bradbury,love,"If we listened to our intellect, we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go into business, because we'd be cynical. Well, that's nonsense. You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down."

Carlton Cuse,love,"If you go to a movie and it's a great experience, the experience at the end of it is always like this sadness that it's over, that your time with these characters is finished. There's almost like an achy feeling that I have when I go to a movie that I love and it ends."
Bill Simmons,love,"If you had told me in 1997 that even 5 people would be waiting online for me to sign my new book in 2009, I would have jumped around like Joe Carter in the 1993 World Series. I love it. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like it. The only thing I worry about is carpal tunnel syndrome - my last tour almost caused it."
Cass Sunstein,love,"If you have an architecture of control, let's say, where you select in advance everything that's going to affect your life, then you're going to live in a very small world that will have an echo chamber feature... Pandora, which I love, actually feeds into that."
Ann Landers,love,"If you have love in your life, it can make up for a great many things that are missing. If you don't have love in your life, no matter what else there is, it's not enough."
Jung Chang,love,"If you have love, even plain cold water is sweet."
Maya Angelou,love,"If you have only one smile in you, give it to the people you love. Don't be surly at home, then go out in the street and start grinning ''Good morning'' at total strangers."
Mother Theresa,love,"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."
Branford Marsalis,love,"If you listen to a lot of the songs that are popular now, there's very little melody in there. People love the beat. But to musicians, it's melody, because we understand how elusive it is and how hard it is to hold."
Bruce Lee,love,"If you love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of."

Brett Hoebel,love,"If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym, you're missing the point completely. If you think that going on a diet has something to do with nutrition, you don't see the forest through the trees. It is a lifestyle. I know it sounds cliche, but you have to find things you love to do."
Will Rogers,love,"If you want to be successful, it's just this simple. Know what you are doing. Love what you are doing. And believe in what you are doing.,

Christian Nevell Bovee,love,"In ambition, as in love, the successful can afford to be indulgent toward their rivals. The prize our own, it is graceful to recognize the merit that vainly aspired to it."

George Santayana,love,"In endowing us with memory, nature has revealed to us a truth utterly unimaginable to the unreflective creation, the truth of immortality. The most ideal human passion is love, which is also the most absolute and animal and one of the most ephemeral."
Jami,love,"In every veil you see, the Divine Beauty is concealed, making every heart a slave to him. In love to him the heart finds its life; in desire for him the soul finds its happiness. The heart which loves a fair one here, though it knows it not, is really his lover."
Bell Hooks,love,"In general, the mass media tell us that black people are not loving, that our lives are so fraught with violence and aggression that we have no time to love."

Alexis de Tocqueville,love,"In no other country in the world is the love of property keener or more alert than in the United States, and nowhere else does the majority display less inclination toward doctrines which in any way threaten the way property is owned."
Malcolm X,love,"In order for a man to really understand himself he must be part of a nation; he must have some land of his own, a God of his own, a language of his own. Most of all he must have love and devotion for his own kind."
Salvador Dali,love,"In order to acquire a growing and lasting respect in society, it is a good thing, if you possess great talent, to give, early in your youth, a very hard kick to the right shin of the society that you love. After that, be a snob."

Bill Cosby,love,"In spite of the six thousand manuals on child raising in the bookstores, child raising is still a dark continent and no one really knows anything. You just need a lot of love and luck - and, of course, courage."
Orson Welles,love,"In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did they produce? The cuckoo clock!"

Blair Underwood,love,"In terms of the black female audience, usually if you're true to that character but more so in your body of work if you've proven that you love your sisters and you proven you will come back home like in 42.4% they'll give you a pass when you jump ship. I hear it all the time."

Judy Garland,love,"In the silence of night I have often wished for just a few words of love from one man, rather than the applause of thousands of people."
Carice van Houten,love,"In the streets, they're very nice. On Twitter, there are people who love to hate me. Sometimes people get mean.

Billie Holiday,love,"In this country, don't forget, a habit is no damn private hell. There's no solitary confinement outside of jail. A habit is hell for those you love. And in this country it's the worst kind of hell for those who love you."

And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth."
Charles Simmons,love,"Integrity is the first step to true greatness. Men love to praise, but are slow to practice it. To maintain it in high places costs self-denial; in all places it is liable to opposition, but its end is glorious, and the universe will yet do it homage."

Vikram Seth,love,Is it not love that knows how to make smooth things rough and rough things smooth?

,
"
Eric Hoffer,love,It almost seems that nobody can hate America as much as native Americans. America needs new immigrants to love and cherish it.

"

Voltaire,love,"It is not love that should be depicted as blind, but self-love."
Henry Ward Beecher,love,It is not work that kills men; it is worry. Work is healthy; you can hardly put more upon a man than he can bear. Worry is the rust upon the blade. It is not the revolution which destroys the machinery but the friction. Fear secretes acids; but love and trust are sweet juices
Anatole Broyard,love,It is one of the paradoxes of American literature that our writers are forever looking back with love and nostalgia at lives they couldn't wait to leave.

Assata Shakur,love,"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.,
It is our duty to win.,
We must love each other and support each other.,
We have nothing to lose but our chains."

May Sarton,love,It is the privilege of those who fear love to murder those who do not fear it!

Charles Baudelaire,love,"It is unfortunately very true that, without leisure and money, love can be no more than an orgy of the common man. Instead of being a sudden impulse full of ardor and reverie, it becomes a distastefully utilitarian affair."

John Galsworthy,love,"It isn't enough to love people because they're good to you, or because in some way or other you're going to get something by it. We have to love because we love loving."

Robert Collier,love,It sometimes seems that we have only to love a thing greatly to get it.
Adam Baldwin,love,It was never the fame or fortune that drove me to act. It was something I love and enjoy doing it. A lot of people identify who they are by what they do and that's not me. It's what I do but not who I am. Who I am is a parent. I'm a family man.
Buddy Wakefield,love,"It was not my intention to make such a production of the emptiness between us, playing tuba on the tombstone of a soprano to try to keep some dead singer's perspective alive. It's just that I could have swore you had sung me a love song back there; and that you meant it."
Ben Harper,love,It will make a weak man mighty. it will make a mighty man fall. It will fill your heart and hands or leave you with nothing at all. It's the eyes for the blind and legs for the lame. It is the love for hate and pride for shame. That's the power of the gospel.
Lord Melbourne,love,"It wounds a man less to confess that he has failed in any pursuit through idleness, neglect, the love of pleasure, etc., etc., which are his own faults, than through incapacity and unfitness, which are the faults of his nature."

Caroline Dhavernas,love,"It's funny because I think it also goes very well with the show. It has this reputation as being this love city where everyone goes to get married, but when you get there, it's very corny and tacky."
Ann Beattie,love,It's gratifying that it does; I love to give readings.
Bill Hicks,love,"It's just a ride and we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money, a choice, right now, between fear and love.

Anna Held,love,"No one ever tells us the truth, even those we love."

Sir Thomas Malory,love,"Nowadays men cannot love seven night but they must have all their desires: that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon accorded and hasty, heat soon it cooleth.

Brea Grant,love,"Oh my God, I'm so excited. I love Comic-Con, it feels like a weird nerd camp. All my nerd friends are there and all the comic book writers I know and then a lot of actors, too, and you hang out with these people for just a few days, but you hang out with them all day, every day.

 And nothing will remain, ,
 And miles around they'll say that I ,

Oscar Wilde,love,"People who love only once in their lives are shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.

Benny Green,love,"Ray had so much love of life and the music. He had so much integrity. He treated the music with so much dignity and respect. I spent four and a half years as a sideman with Ray Brown's trio. Music was his life, more so than anyone I could mention."

"

Francesco Petrarca,love,"To be able to say how much love, is love but little."

Peter de Vries,love,"We must love one another, yes, yes, that's all true enough, but nothing says we have to like each other. It may be the very recognition of all men as our brothers that accounts for the sibling rivalry, and even enmity, we have toward so many of them."

Bruce Barton,love,"We pay just as dearly for our triumphs as we do for our defeats. Go ahead and fail. But fail with wit, fail with grace, fail with style.

La Bruyere,love,We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together.

John Lennon,love,"We've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it."

Benjamin Bratt,love,"Well, for me, the real excitement of doing physical things in films, whether you're talking about a fight scene or a stunt sequence or even a love scene, for that matter, is by necessity it has to be choreographed very much like a dance. That being said, you have to rehearse it over and over again and find a mathematical precision."

Oscar Wilde,love,"What a fuss people make about fidelity! Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say."

Arthur Schwartz,love,What I love about Brooklyn is there are more wonderful little joints than anywhere.
St. Augustine of Hippo,love,"What I needed most was to love and to be loved, eager to be caught. Happily I wrapped those painful bonds around me; and sure enough, I would be lashed with the red-hot pokers or jealousy, by suspicions and fear, by burst of anger and quarrels."

Blaise Pascal,love,"When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although one did not know it. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours."
Alfred Kazin,love,"When a writer talks about his work, he's talking about a love affair."
Carl Jung,love,"When animus and anima meet, the animus draws his sword of power and the anima ejects her poison of illusion and seduction. The outcome need not always be negative, since the two are equally likely to fall in love (a special instance of love at first sight)."

Bob Harper,love,"When I was first introduced to CrossFit, I found it to be the hardest workout that I'd ever done. It wiped the floor with me, and I fell in love with it immediately.

Ben Stein,life,"But when I talk to people who are Darwinists or evolutionists and say, 'Well, how did life begin' -- they're...they don't have an answer. I mean, they have an answer, but it's a BS answer. It's an answer that wouldn't make sense to a small child."

Carl Jung,life,"Caution has its place, no doubt, but we cannot refuse our support to a serious venture which challenges the whole of the personality.

During the 1950s and 1960s, when the economy was excellent, crime rose again."

Ben Stein,life,"Evolutionism, as taught by Darwinism, has nothing - nothing - to say about how life originated.

Martina Navratilova,life,I came to live in a country I love; some people label me a defector. I have loved men and women in my life; I've been labeled ''the bisexual defector'' in print. Want to know another secret? I'm even ambidextrous. I don't like labels. Just call me Martina.
Ben Stein,life,I came to realize that life lived to help others is the only one that matters and that it is my duty...This is my highest and best use as a human.
Ernest Renan,life,I can die when I wish to: that is my elixir of life.

Bryce Dallas Howard,life,"I can only really speak for myself and what I've noticed in my kids and the people in my life, but because dinosaurs were real, and yet they seem so fantastical, is why they held such a huge fascination for me as a child. They're so different from human beings."
Luis Bunuel,life,"I can only wait for the final amnesia, the one that can erase an entire life."

Dudley Nichols,life,"I devoutly believe it is the writer who has matured the film medium more than anyone else in Hollywood. Even when he knew nothing about his work, he brought at least knowledge of life and a more grown-up mind, a maturer feeling about the human being."
Javan,life,"I didn't ask for it to be over. But then again I didn't ask for it to begin. For that's the way it is with life, as some of the most beautiful days come completely by chance. But even the most beautiful days eventually have their sunset"

Boris Pasternak,life,I don't like people who have never fallen or stumbled. Their virtue is lifeless and it isn't of much value. Life hasn't revealed its beauty to them.
Bruce Springsteen,life,"I don't like to write rhetorically or get on a soapbox. I try to make the stuff multi-layered, so that it always has a life outside its social context. I don't believe that you can tell people anything; you can only draw them in."
Arthur Hailey,life,I don't think I really invented anybody. I have drawn on real life.
Sebastian Faulks,life,I don't think you ever understand your life - not till it's finished and probably not then either. The more I live the less I seem to understand.
Peter Carey,life,I don't think you have the right to shout about other people's private life.
Carrie Fisher,life,I don't want life to imitate art. I want life to be art.
Diane Ackerman,life,I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I have just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well.
Bhagat Singh,life,"I emphasize that I am full of ambition and hope and of full charm of life. But I can renounce all at the time of need, and that is the real sacrifice.

Pablo Casals,life,I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance.
Marianne Williamson,life,"I fell in love with the thought that a human life could be a priestly conduit, a connecting link between earth and sky. As I grew and stumbled and, most important, as I began to love and be loved, I realized that the ultimate priest is the lover inside us"
Bryan Batt,life,"I firmly believe that life is an 'and' proposition and not an 'or' one. If you really love something, you just have to try it. The worse that can happen is that you'll be told 'no.'"
Bruce Bennett,life,"I guess the one thing I really learned from participating in sports was to just never say no, never stop trying, and to always believe that you can do better than the next fellow. I tried to follow this throughout my life, but I always tried to be respectful about it."
Anthony Doerr,life,I guess you could say I've been writing all my life.

Tony Bennett,life,"I have a simple life. I mean, you just give me a drum roll, they announce my name, and I come out and sing. In my job I have a contract that says I'm a singer. So I sing."

Tupac Shakur,life,"I just don't know how to deal with so many people giving me that much affection. I never had that in my life.,

"
Warren Mitchell,life,"I knew that I did not have to buy into society's notion that I had to be handsome and healthy to be happy. I was in charge of my ''spaceship'' and it was my up, my down. I could choose to see this situation as a setback or as a starting point. I chose to begin life again."

Oscar Wilde,life,"I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life."
Caitlyn Jenner,life,"I learned that the only way you are going to get anywhere in life is to work hard at it. Whether you're a musician, a writer, an athlete or a businessman, there is no getting around it. If you do, you'll win - if you don't you won t."
Dr. Seuss,life,I like nonsense - it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living. It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope... and that enables you to laugh at all of life's realities.
Theodor S. Geisel,life,I like nonsense - it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living. It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope...and that enables you to laugh at all of life's realities.

Nancy Reagan,life,I must say that acting was good training for the political life that lay ahead of us.
Anne Sullivan Macy,life,"I need a teacher quite as much as Helen. I know the education of this child will be the distinguishing event of my life, if I have the brains and perseverance to accomplish it."
Oscar Wilde,life,"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do."

Lord Nelson,life,I owe all my success in life to having been always a quarter of an hour before my time.
André Gide,life,"I owe much to my friends; but, all things considered, it strikes me that I owe even more to my enemies. The real person springs life under a sting even better than under a caress."
Oscar Wilde,life,I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works.
Benazir Bhutto,life,I put my life in danger and came here because I feel this country is in danger. People are worried. We will bring the country out of this crisis.
Anna Quindlen,life,"I read and walked for miles at night along the beach, writing bad blank verse and searching endlessly for someone wonderful who would step out of the darkness and change my life. It never crossed my mind that that person could be me."
Anne Wilson Schaef,life,"I realize that humor isn't for everyone. It's only for people who want to have fun, enjoy life, and feel alive."
Anna Quindlen,life,"I realized that, while I would never be my mother nor have her life, the lesson she had left me was that it was possible to love and care for a man and still have at your core a strength so great that you never even needed to put it on display."
Assata Shakur,life,"I really prefer to be kind of anonymous. Because when people know your whole history, they have a tendency to relate to you differently and maybe put you up on a pedestal. I want people to just be normal with me. I just want to live my life."
Brigitte Bardot,life,"I really wanted to die at certain periods in my life. Death was like love, a romantic escape. I took pills because I didn't want to throw myself off my balcony and know people would photograph me lying dead below."
Samuel Butler,life,"I reckon being ill as one of the great pleasures of life, provided one is not too ill and is not obliged to work till one is better."
George Sand,life,"I regard as a mortal sin not only the lying of the senses in matters of love, but also the illusion which the senses seek to create where love is only partial. I say, I believe, that one must love with all of one's being, or else live, come what may, a life of complete chastity."
Abraham Lincoln,life,I remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life.
Arthur Rimbaud,life,"I saw that all beings are fated to happiness: action is not life, but a way of wasting some force, an enervation. Morality is the weakness of the brain."
George F. Will,life,"I say statecraft is soulcraft. Just as all education is moral education because learning conditions conduct, most legislation is moral legislations because it conditions the action and the thought of the nation in broad and important spheres in life."
Abbie Hoffman,life,I see Judaism as a way of life. Sticking up for the underdog. Being an outsider. A critic of society. The kid on the corner who says the emperor has no clothes on. The Prophet.
Anais Nin,life,I seek the real stuff of life. Profound drama.
Benjamin Franklin,life,"I should have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the end: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a second edition the faults of the first."
Gertrude Stein,life,"I simply contend that the middle-class ideal which demands that people be affectionate, respectable, honest and content, that they avoid excitements and cultivate serenity is the ideal that appeals to me, it is in short the ideal of affectionate family life, of honorable business methods."
Ludwig Wittgenstein,life,I sit astride life like a bad rider on a horse. I only owe it to the horse's good nature that I am not thrown off at this very moment.

Ralph Waldo Emerson,life,"I suffer whenever I see that common sight of a parent or senior imposing his opinion and way of thinking and being on a young soul to which they are totally unfit. Cannot we let people be themselves, and enjoy life in their own way? You are trying to make that man another you. One's enough."
A. N. Wilson,life,"I suppose if I'd got a brilliant first and done research I might still be a don today, but I hope not. People become dons because they are incapable of doing anything else in life."

Herb Caen,life,I tend to live in the past because most of my life is there.

Henry van Dyke,life,I thank God for the honesty and virility of Jesus religion which makes us face the facts and calls us to take a man's part in the real battle of life.
James Baldwin,life,I think Americans are terrified of feeling anything. I never met a people more infantile in my life.
Stephen Hawking,life,I think computer viruses should count as life … I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.
Tiger Woods,life,"I think it's an honor to be a role model to one person or maybe more than that. If you are given a chance to be a role model, I think you should always take it because you can influence a person's life in a positive light, and that's what I want to do. That's what it's all about."
Bryan Batt,life,"I think living my happy, open life and showing young gay kids you can be successful, you can have love in your life, you can be a contributing member of society and you can be respected - I think that's it."
Antonia Fraser,life,I think mine is the fullest and most plausible account of what went on in Marie Antoinette's life.
David Cronenberg,life,"I think of horror films as art, as films of confrontation. Films that make you confront aspects of your own life that are difficult to face. Just because you're making a horror film doesn't mean you can't make an artful film."
Mark Haddon,life,"I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them."
Joe Namath,life,"I think that at some point in your life you realize you don't have to worry if you do everything you're supposed to do right. Or if not right, if you do it the best you can... what can worry do for you? You are already doing the best you can."
Aldous Huxley,life,"I think that fiction. history and biography are immensely important, because they provide a picture of life now and of life in the past."

"
Burn Gorman,life,"I think there comes a time in every persons life where they just need to go to the darkest, most dismal place."
Bryce Dallas Howard,life,"I think what's exciting about playing a villain - particularly a villain who's totally unapologetic about their evil intentions - is that it's not anything remotely like what you get to do in real life. You're never allowed to be evil and not feel bad about it afterwards, let alone be evil, period."
Lauren Bacall,life,I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that.
Buffalo Bill,life,"I thought I was benefiting the Indians as well as the government, by taking them all over the United States, and giving them a correct idea of the customs, life, etc., of the pale faces, so that when they returned to their people they could make known all they had seen."
Busta Rhymes,life,"I try to really understand every aspect of the most high; for me, the most high is Allah... I live my life by Islam."

Robin Williams,life,"I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.,

Alanis Morissette,life,I want to walk through life instead of being dragged through it.
Anthony Hopkins,life,"I wanted revenge; I wanted to dance on the graves of a few people who made me unhappy. It's a pretty infantile way to go through life - I'll show them - but I've done it, and I've got more than I ever dreamed of."
Walter Savage Landor,life,"I warmed both hands before the fire of life; It sinks, and I am ready to depart."
Anne Perry,life,"I was born in London, England, in 1938, a few months before the war, and spent the first years of my life there, although I was evacuated a couple of times for short periods. My schooling was very interrupted, both by frequent moves and by ill health."

Adam Sandler,life,"I was raised by a mother who told me I was great every day of my life.,
"
Al Sharpton,life,"I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker, put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start, but where you're going. That's family values."
Brooke Shields,life,I went to an ordinary school in New York City with no other actors. I learned to compartmentalise different parts of my life. I was one person at home and then another person at work and for that reason my career didn't challenge my family life.
Bryce Harper,life,"I went to school, but nobody really noticed me. I just came to school, didn't dress up or anything - just a ghost. I just worked out and went out to the field and went the baseball route. That's how I've always been my whole life."
Seneca,life,"I will govern my life and thoughts as if the whole world were to see the one and read the other, for what does it signify to make anything a secret to my neighbor, when to God, who is the searcher of our hearts, all our privacies are open?"

Bianca Lawson,life,"I'm a pretty low key person when it comes to style, I love to be comfortable all the time. I love getting dressed up when I'm going out. But most of the time, I just like to be comfortable. It's really annoying to everyone in my life, but I love it."
Bill Goldberg,life,I'm a professional athlete. I've been paid since I was in my early 20s to go out there and fight with guys who were 40 or 50 pounds heavier than I am and fight for my life. I got into a business where people make decisions based on some of the most stupid things.

Barbara Kruger,life,"I'm living my life, not buying a lifestyle."

Vikram Seth,life,"I'm not sure anyone can understand a whole life, even their own."

Armistead Maupin,life,I've always drawn on bits and pieces of my own life.
Buffy Sainte-Marie,life,"I've always had that attitude about my career: it's something that I do, but it's not my whole life. I have a real life, a personal life: I've got a lot of chickens, I've got a horse, I've got a kitty-cat, I've got a lot of goats, I've got animals all over the place."

Baltasar Kormakur,life,"I've always looked at filmmaking as a lifestyle. There is no decision of when you go to work.

Ann Landers,life,"If I were asked to give what I consider the single most useful bit of advice for all humanity it would be this: Expect trouble as an inevitable part of life and when it comes, hold you head high, look it squarely in the eye and say, ''I will be bigger than you. You cannot defeat me.''"
Bernie Siegel,life,"If I were rewriting 'Love, Medicine & Miracles,' I might consider changing its title to 'The Side Effects of Cancer.' Healing is hard work, as is any change one must make in one's life. I and others have learned, however, that the side effects of cancer may not all be bad ones."

David Hume,life,"It is not reason which is the guide of life, but custom."
Alan Cohen,life,It is not selfish to be happy. It is your highest purpose. Your joy is the greatest contribution you can make to life on the planet. A heart at peace with its owner blesses everyone it touches.
Cesare Pavese,life,"It is not that the child lives in a world of imagination, but that the child within us survives and starts into life only at rare moments of recollection, which makes us believe, and it is not true, that, as children, we were imaginative?"

Carl Levin,life,"It is of the utmost importance that our service members are adequately compensated for their duties, and that we offer them a quality of life that will enable them to continue to serve and to live comfortably."
Simone de Beauvoir,life,"It is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life. Old age is life's parody, whereas death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension. Death does away with time."
Ralph Waldo Emerson,life,It is one of the most beautiful compensations in life that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.
George Orwell,life,"It is one of the tragedies of the half-educated that they develop late, when they are already committed to some wrong way of life."
Arthur Schopenhauer,life,"It is only a man's own fundamental thoughts that have truth and life in them. For it is these that he really and completely understands. To read the thoughts of others is like taking the remains of someone else's meal, like putting on the discarded clothes of a stranger."
C. P. Snow,life,It is only by the rational use of technology; to control and guide what technology is doing; that we can keep any hopes of a social life more desirable than our own: or in fact of a social life which is not appalling to imagine.

Robert Collier,life,"It is only when you despair of all ordinary means, it is only when you convince it that it must help you or you perish, that the seed of life in you bestirs itself to provide a new resource."
Boris Johnson,life,"It is possible to have a pretty good life and career being a leech and a parasite in the media world, gadding about from TV studio to TV studio, writing inconsequential pieces and having a good time."
George Mcgovern,life,"It is simply untrue that all our institutions are evil that all politicians are mere opportunists, that all aspects of university life are corrupt. Having discovered an illness, it's not terribly useful to prescribe death as a cure."
Cate Blanchett,life,It is so interesting when you meet an actor in real life and they look completely different.
Bill Brandt,life,"It is the gift of seeing the life around them clearly and vividly, as something that is exciting in its own right. It is an innate gift, varying in intensity with the individual's temperament and environment."
James Russell Lowell,life,"It is the privilege of genius that life never grows common place, as it does for the rest of us."
Boris Sidis,life,"It is time that the medical and teaching profession should realize that functional neurosis is not congenital, not inborn, not hereditary, but is the result of a defective, fear-inspiring education in early child life."
Adam Clarke,life,"It is to be regretted that few persons who have arrived at any degree of eminence or fame, have written Memorials of themselves, at least such as have embraced their private as well as their public life."
Emile Durkheim,life,It is too great comfort which turns a man against himself. Life is most readily renounced at the time and among the classes where it is least harsh.
C. J. Mahaney,life,It is true that I have been studying both humility and pride for many years for the purpose of weakening pride in my own life and cultivating humility by the grace of God.

Lord George Byron,life,It is very certain that the desire of life prolongs it.
Anne Enright,life,It is very hard to trace the effect of words on a life.
Augustus Hare,life,"It is well for us that we are born babies in intellect. Could we understand half what mothers say and do to their infants, we should be filled with a conceit of our own importance, which would render us insupportable through life."
Pablo Picasso,life,It is your work in life that is your ultimate seduction.
Armistead Maupin,life,"It may interest you to know that my breakup with Terry and this mystery did not happen concurrently in real life. That is a writer's device, which places Gabriel under even greater pressure when the mystery begins to reveal itself."
Blake Mycoskie,life,"It may sound too good to be true, but once you've seen the happiest people in your life who have nothing, you really start rethinking what the world, and society, tells us that we need to be happy."
Bertie Carvel,life,"It might sound glib, but in a sense, as an actor I'm a journalist and a psychologist recording life and truth."
Benjamin E. Mays,life,It must be borne in mind that the tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goals to reach.
Ben E. King,life,It never dawned on me at any particular time of my life that people are paid tremendous money to sing.
Oscar Wilde,life,"It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style."
Bob Keeshan,life,"It requires more strength to be gentle, so it's the everyday encounters of life that I think we've prepared children for and prepared them to be good to other people and to consider other people."
T. S. Eliot,life,It seems just possible that a poem might happen to a very young man: but a poem is not poetry. That is a life.
Brooks Atkinson,life,It seems not to have been written. It is the quintessence of life. It is the basic truth.
Calvin Klein,life,It seems there's always another rumor about my life; some people are simply talked about more than others.
Russell Wayne Baker,life,It seems to be a law in American life that whatever enriches us anywhere except in the wallet inevitably becomes uneconomic.
Barbara Bush,life,"It seems to me I spent my life in car pools, but you know, that's how I kept track of what was going on."
Anne Tyler,life,"It seems to me that good novels celebrate the mystery in ordinary life, and summing it all up in psychological terms strips the mystery away."
Fjodor M. Dostojewski,life,"It seems, in fact, as though the second half of a man's life is made up of nothing, but the habits he has accumulated during the first half."
Benjamin Clementine,life,"It stayed with me - the Bible has stayed with me. I've grown out of it because, obviously, you live life for yourself and have your choice to believe what you want to believe in, but I know that the Bible can be used to appreciate life."
Alan Cohen,life,"It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power."
Eknath Easwaran,life,It takes a lot of experience of life to see why some relationships last and others do not. But we do not have to wait for a crisis to get an idea of the future of a particular relationship. Our behavior in little every incidents tells us a great deal.
Bruce Barton,life,It takes a real storm in the average person's life to make him realize how much worrying he has done over the squalls.
Napoleon Hill,life,"It takes half your life before you discover life is a do-it-yourself project.,
"
Barry Took,life,"It was a joy to be a part of the team that created Round The Horne. I was involved with the show at a time of my life when I was very happy., and that happiness overflowed into the scripts."
Bille August,life,"It was a major dream come true at last. In many respects, Jerusalem is a very modern and important story about people in a period of transition, with all the unrest that permeates society on the eve of a new century. The big life issues are at stake."
Orson Scott Card,life,"It was just him and me. He fought with honor. If it weren't for his honor, he and the others would have beaten me together. They might have killed me, then. His sense of honor saved my life. I didn't fight with honor... I fought to win."
Barbara Cooney,life,"It was not until I was in my forties, in the fifth decade of my life, that the sense of place, the spirit of place, became of paramount importance to me. It was then that I began my travels, that I discovered, through photography, the quality of light, and that I gradually became able to paint the mood of place."
Lord George Byron,life,It was one of the deadliest and heaviest feelings of my life to feel that I was no longer a boy. From that moment I began to grow old in my own esteem - and in my esteem age is not estimable.
Bernadette Peters,life,"It was one of the most exciting, perfect evenings of my life, my solo debut at Carnegie Hall. And knowing we were all there to raise money for Gay Men's Health Crisis made the evening an extraordinary experience."
Brian Austin Green,life,"It was really like waking up one morning and going, Wow, I enjoy being with this person more than anybody else in my life, and it just turned out to be mutual."
Bipasha Basu,life,"It was Vikram Bhatt and 'Raaz' that got me interested in the medium of cinema. Before that, I was like any other youngster dabbling with various things - modelling, films - without a definite direction or focus. Now that I'm working with all of them, life has come full circle for me."
Scott O'Grady,life,"It wasn't the reward that mattered or the recognition you might harvest. It was your depth of commitment, your quality of service, the product of your devotion - these were the things that counted in a life. When you gave purely, the honor came in the giving, and that was honor enough."
Belinda Carlisle,life,It will shock many - I've lived a full life and really enjoyed my time as a pop star.
William Somerset Maugham,life,"It's a funny thing about life: if you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it."

Freeman Dyson,life,It's better to get mugged than to live a life of fear.
Silas Weir Mitchell,life,It's easier traveling the road of life when I don't have so much to carry on my back.
Jim Rohn,life,"It's easy to let life deteriorate into making a living instead of making a life. It's not the hours you put in, but what you out into the hours that count. Learn to express rather than impress. Expressing evokes a ''me too'' attitude while impressing evokes a ''so what'' attitude."
Bethany Hamilton,life,"It's easy to look at the things of this world to solve our challenges and obstacles in life, but when we submit our lives to Christ, His grace, mercy, peace and love will bring true fulfillment to our lives."
Bianca Kajlich,life,"It's easy when you've had difficulty or strife in your life to look at other people who seem like they've had it easier. But the thing we forget is that it is all relative, and each person's experience is uniquely their own, so that the worst thing they may be going through is truly the worst thing for them... it's just about having compassion."
Joseph Conrad,life,"It's extraordinary how we go through life with eyes half shut, with dull ears, with dormant thoughts. Perhaps it's just as well; and it may be that it is this very dullness that makes life to the incalculable majority so supportable and so welcome."
Oliver Wendell Holmes,life,"It's faith in something and enthusiasm for something that makes a life worth living.,

Jack Lemmon,life,"It's hard enough to write a good drama, it's much harder to write a good comedy, and it's hardest of all to write a drama with comedy. Which is what life is."
Ann Beattie,life,"It's interesting, though, that in daily life, I think of myself as being relatively unobservant."
Adam Grant,life,"It's ironic that when you go through a tragedy, you appreciate more. You realize how fragile life is and that there are so many things to still be thankful for.,
"
Brian Austin Green,life,"It's just a fact of life. Everybody grows up and goes through changes, and our audience has seen it all."
Alan Alda,life,It's not an epitaph. I felt I could look back at my life and get a good story out of it. It's a picture of somebody trying to figure things out. I'm not trying to create some impression about myself. That doesn't interest me.
Candice Bergen,life,"It's not just in Hollywood that women run the risk of being passed by once they reach 50. It happens in real life, too."

Max Frisch,life,"It's precisely the disappointing stories, which have no proper ending and therefore no proper meaning, that sound true to life."
Alan Alda,life,"It's really clear to me that you can't hang onto something longer than its time. Ideas lose certain freshness, ideas have a shelf life, and sometimes they have to be replaced by other ideas."
Beth Riesgraf,life,"It's so weird, not knowing what your life is going to be. I'm being optimistic. And when 'Leverage' comes to an end, I have lots of ideas for other things. You can't really sit and wait for things to come to you."
Agnetha Faltskog,life,It's strange that the newspapers don't see a connection between their false revelations about my private life and my need for seclusion and security.
Sidney J. Harris,life,"It's surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their feelings toward themselves, and if you're not comfortable within yourself, you can't be comfortable with others."
Bill Bailey,life,"It's the augmented fourth, or diminished fifth, depending on your outlook on life..."
Brigitte Bardot,life,It's the decomposition that gets me. You spend your whole life looking after your body. And then you rot away.
Brenda Blethyn,life,"It's the same as any role and I find that you can't lump characters together; because they all have different life experiences, different reasons for being the way they are."
Bjorn Borg,life,"It's tough when you're No. 1. You don't have any private life, you can't even walk anywhere. I think that was one reason why I lost my motivation to play tennis."

Barry Gibb,life,"It's very questionable, and we will pursue every factor, every element, every second of the timeline, of the final hours of Maurice's life. We will pursue that relentlessly. That will be our quest from now on."
Anthony Robbins,life,It's your unlimited power to care and to love that can make the biggest difference in the quality of your life.

Barbara Ward,life,"Jews were the first to believe that history itself has meaning and that progress, not repetition, is the law of life."
Buddy Wakefield,life,Jordan tattoos the words forgive me in thick black letters down the inside of his arm so that when he looks at his wrist he will remember not to hate himself so much. What he keeps forgetting is that there is life after survival.
Gilbert K. Chesterton,life,"Journalism is popular, but it is popular mainly as fiction. Life is one world, and life seen in the newspapers another."
Gilbert Keith Chesterton,life,"Journalism is popular, but it is popular mainly as fiction. Life is one world, and life seen in the newspapers is another.,
"
Leo Tolstoy,life,"Joy can be real only if people look on their life as a service, and have a definite object in life outside themselves and their personal happiness."
Rollo May,life,"Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity."
Friedrich Nietzsche,life,"Judgments, value judgments concerning life, for or against, can in the last resort never be true: they possess value only as symptoms, they come into consideration only as symptoms - in themselves such judgments are stupidities."
Desiderius Erasmus,life,"Jupiter, not wanting man's life to be wholly gloomy and grim, has bestowed far more passion than reason - you could reckon the ration as twenty-four to one. Moreover, he confined reason to a cramped corner of the head and left all the rest of the body to the passions."
Buddha,life,"Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life."
Leonardo Da Vinci,life,Just as courage imperils life; fear protects it.
Søren Kierkegaard,life,"Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God."
Buzz Aldrin,life,"Just as Mars - a desert planet - gives us insights into global climate change on Earth, the promise awaits for bringing back to life portions of the Red Planet through the application of Earth Science to its similar chemistry, possibly reawakening its life-bearing potential."
Regis McKenna,life,"Just as one year in a dog's life is equivalent to seven years in a human life, one year in the high-technology business is like seven years in any other industry."
Vaclav Havel,life,"Just as the constant increase of entropy is the basic law of the universe, so it is the basic law of life to be ever more highly structured and to struggle against entropy."
Albert Schweitzer,life,"Just as the wave cannot exist for itself, but is ever a part of the heaving surface of the ocean, so must I never live my life for itself, but always in the experience which is going on around me."
Buddha,life,"Just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue."
Benny Green,life,"Just to have that sense of family, it gives you something that you know you need to take care of for the rest of your life. People gave it to him, and he passed it on to us."

John McCain,life,"Keep moving if you love life, and keep your troubles well behind you."
Emanuel Swedenborg,life,"Kindness is an inner desire that makes us want to do good things even if we do not get anything in return. It is the joy of our life to do them. When we do good things from this inner desire, there is kindness in everything we think, say, want and do."
Isaac Bashevis Singer,life,"Kindness, I've discovered, is everything in life."
Benjamin Disraeli,life,King Louis Philippe once said to me that he attributed the great success of the British nation in political life to their talking politics after dinner.

Bhagat Singh,life,"L. Ram Saran Das was sentenced to death in 1915, and the sentence was later commuted to life transportation. Today myself, sitting in the condemned cell, I can let the readers know as authoritatively that the life-imprisonment is comparatively a far harder lot than that of death."
Bill Shorten,life,"Labor should not be about creating monuments on hills or statues in parks. Labor's monuments and statues are when a young person can find a job, when a person with disability can get access to the ordinary life that others take for granted."

Allen Klein,life,"Laughter, and the broader category of humor, are key elements in helping us go on with our life after a loss."

Bethany Hamilton,life,"Learning how to deal with people and their reactions to my life is one of the most challenging things... people staring at me, people asking rude questions, dealing with media, stuff like that."
Robert Byrne,life,Learning to dislike children at an early age saves a lot of expense and aggravation later in life.
Carol Shields,life,"Learning to skip has brought control into her life. Whenever she feels all sad, she switches into this wholly happy gait, sliding, hopping, and sliding again; when doing this, it seems as though her head separates from her body, making her feel dizzy and emptied out of bad thoughts. Does anyone else know this trick, she wonders? Probably not, although her Mother sometimes smiles and waves from the window."
Andre Breton,life,"Leave everything. Leave Dada. Leave your wife. Leave your mistress. Leave your hopes and fears. Leave your children in the woods. Leave the substance for the shadow. Leave your easy life, leave what you are given for the future. Set off on the roads."
Adrienne Rich,life,Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life. It is also a direct or indirect attack on the male right of access to women.
Edward Young,life,Less base the fear of death than fear of life.

Voltaire,life,"Let us work without theorizing, 'Tis the only way to make life endurable."
Buddha,life,Let yourself be open and life will be easier. A spoon of salt in a glass of water makes the water undrinkable. A spoon of salt in a lake is almost unnoticed.
Greg Anderson,life,"Let's face it. In most of life we really are interdependent. We need each other. Staunch independence is an illusion, but heavy dependence isn't healthy, either. The only position of long-term strength is interdependence: win/win."
Lord George Byron,life,"Let's not unman each otherpart at once; All farewells should be sudden, when forever, Else they make an eternity of moments, And clog the last sad sands of life with tears."

Samuel Johnson,life,"Life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties, passing from one step of success to another, forming new wishes and seeing them gratified."

David Herbert Lawrence,life,"Life and love are life and love, a bunch of violets is a bunch of violets, and to drag in the idea of a point is to ruin everything. Live and let live, love and let love, flower and fade, and follow the natural curve, which flows on, pointless."
Charlotte Brontë,life,"Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs."
Morarji Desai,life,Life at any time can become difficult: life at any time can become easy. It all depends upon how one adjusts oneself to life.
George Bernard Shaw,life,Life at its noblest leaves mere happiness far behind; and indeed cannot endure it. Happiness is not the object of life: life has no object: it is an end in itself; and courage consists in the readiness to sacrifice happiness for an intenser quality of life.
Oliver Goldsmith,life,"Life at the greatest and best is but a froward child, that must be humored and coaxed a little till it falls asleep, and then all the care is over."

Horace,life,Life gives nothing to man without labor.
Philip Larkin,life,"Life has a practice of living you, if you don't live it."

Georges Bataille,life,"Life has always taken place in a tumult without apparent cohesion, but it only finds its grandeur and its reality in ecstasy and in ecstatic love."
Oliver Goldsmith,life,"Life has been compared to a race, but the allusion improves by observing, that the most swift are usually the least manageable and the most likely to stray from the course. Great abilities have always been less serviceable to the possessors than moderate ones."

Barbara Bush,life,"Life has changed enormously, and I hope - I hope more people read good things."
Woody Guthrie,life,"Life has got a habit of not standing hitched. You got to ride it like you find it. You got to change with it. If a day goes by that don't change some of your old notions for new ones, that is just about like trying to milk a dead cow."

Antoine Rivarol,life,"Man spends his life in reasoning on the past, in complaining of the present, in fearing future."

Camille Paglia,life,"Men are run ragged by female sexuality all their lives. From the beginning of his life to the end, no man ever fully commands any woman. It's an illusion. Men are pussy-whipped.

Aristotle,life,"Men create gods after their own image, not only with regard to their form but with regard to their mode of life."

Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,life,"Millions of people miss meditation because meditation has taken on a wrong connotation. It looks very serious, looks gloomy, has something of the church in it, looks as if it is only for people who are dead, or almost dead, who are gloomy, serious, have long faces, who have lost festivity, fun, playfulness, celebration.... A really meditative person is playful: life is fun for him.... He enjoys it tremendously. He is not serious. He is relaxed."

Tony Benn,life,Most things in life are moments of pleasure and a lifetime of embarrassment; photography is a moment of embarrassment and a lifetime of pleasure.
Aldous Huxley,life,Most vices demand considerable self-sacrifices. There is no greater mistake than to suppose that a vicious life is a life of uninterrupted pleasure. It is a life almost as wearisome and painful - if strenuously led - as Christian's in The Pilgrim's Progress.
Angela Carter,life,"Mother goddesses are just as silly a notion as father gods. If a revival of the myths of these cults gives woman emotional satisfaction, it does so at the price of obscuring the real conditions of life. This is why they were invented in the first place."
Bel Powley,life,"Movies make teenagers have quippy answers for every question. Nothing seems to faze them, and they're like, 'Oh, whatever.' You're not like that when you're a teenager. You're really earnest. Things really feel like life or death. And you kind of oscillate between emotions at one time. It's very emotionally draining being a teenager."
Charles Caleb Colton,life,"Much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time, which every day produces, and which most men throw away, but which nevertheless will make at the end of it no small deduction for the life of man."
Henri Nouwen,life,Much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared.

Red Auerbach,life,Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
Henri-Frédéric Amiel,life,"Mutual respect implies discretion and reserve even in love itself; it means preserving as much liberty as possible to those whose life we share.

Bill Rancic,life,"My best friend Jerry started a boat-washing business, and it was one of the most critical experiences of my life. I got to meet a lot of people who were entrepreneurs.

Robert E. Lee,life,"My experience through life has convinced me that, while moderation and temperance in all things are commendable and beneficial, abstinence from spirituous liquors is the best safeguard of morals and health."
Barack Obama,life,"My family, frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn't raise me in the church, so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead."
Lee Iacocca,life,"My father always used to say that when you die, if you've got five real friends, then you've had a great life."

"
Olive Schreiner,life,"My feeling is that there is nothing in life but refraining from hurting others, and comforting those that are sad."
Bradford Dillman,life,"My feeling is that you should try to do the things you enjoy most in life. I chose acting as a career because I enjoyed it then as I do now. The only question for me then was, 'Can I make a living at it?'"

Bob Ainsworth,life,My heroes are the non-commissioned officers. If I had another life that's what I'd be - a regimental sergeant major or a similar rank. That's where the spirit of the armed forces is.
Barbara Corcoran,life,My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There's no way I can control him. I wouldn't stay married to him if I felt I could.

Bill Walton,life,"My life changed irrevocably four-and-a-half years ago when my spine failed and collapsed. I spent two years on the floor, in excruciating, debilitating and unrelenting pain.

Elvis Costello,life,My ultimate vocation in life is to be an irritant.
Billy Corgan,life,"My version, of course, is not this flag-waving, let's all get on the Jesus train and ride out of hell. I'm not that kind of guy. It's an embrace that life is good, worth living and yeah, it's not easy, but there are more pluses than minuses."

Carol Burnett,life,Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Joseph Conrad,life,"Only in men's imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life."

Bob Marley,life,"Open your eyes, look within. Are you satisfied with the life you're living?"
Bertrand Russell,life,"Organic life, we are told, has developed gradually from the protozoon to the philosopher, and this development, we are assured, is indubitably an advance. Unfortunately it is the philosopher, not the protozoon, who gives us this assurance."
Albert J. Nock,life,"Organized Christianity has always represented immortality as a sort of common heritage; but I never could see why spiritual life should not be conditioned on the same terms as all life, i. e., correspondence with environment."

Earl Nightingale,life,Our attitude toward life determines life's attitude towards us.

Bhagat Singh,life,"Our entire family is replete with sentiments of patriotism. Uncle Swarna Singh left for his heavenly abode in jail in 1910, two or three years after my birth. Uncle Ajit Singh is leading the life of an exile in foreign countries."
Bill Simmons,life,"Our favorite teams bring people together, keep family members close, bond people from different generations. Some of the happiest moments of my life involve something that happened with one of my teams. Some of the best relationships I ever had were with Boston athletes that I never even met."
Arthur Schopenhauer,life,Our first ideas of life are generally taken from fiction rather than fact.
Brit Morin,life,"Our generation grew up with technology. It evolved as we grew up. This new generation has had it since they were babies. That's crazy.

Candice S. Miller,life,"Our Great Lakes, harbors, ports, and rivers provide not only vital resources for us to live, but an entire maritime way of life for so many people. The least we can do is protect it, and the way of life it provides for so many."
L'Chiam,life,Our great men have written words of wisdom to be used when hardship must be faced. Life obliges us with hardship so the words of wisdom shouldn't go to waste.

James Allen,life,"Our life is what our thoughts make it. A man will find that as he alters his thoughts toward things and other people, things and other people will alter towards him."

Edward M. Forster,life,"Our life on earth is, and ought to be, material and carnal. But we have not yet learned to manage our materialism and carnality properly; they are still entangled with the desire for ownership."

Hermann Goering,life,"Our movement took a grip on cowardly Marxism and from it extracted the meaning of socialism. It also took from the cowardly middle-class parties their nationalism. Throwing both into the cauldron of our way of life there emerged, as clear as a crystal, the synthesis - German National Socialism."
Carl Honore,life,"Our obsession with speed, with cramming more and more into every minute, means that we race through life instead of actually living it. Our health, diet and relationships suffer.

Dalai Lama (14th),life,"Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them."
Henry David Thoreau,life,Our whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant's truce between virtue and vice.
Susan Sontag,life,"Ours is a culture based on excess, on overproduction; the result is a steady loss of sharpness in our sensory experience. All the conditions of modern life - its material plenitude, its sheer crowdedness - conjoin to dull our sensory faculties."
Billy Graham,life,"Over the years I've seen people lose a spouse and then withdraw and lose interest in life, and I believe we need to resist that."
Brad Feld,life,"Over the years, I've been involved in many business crises. I qualify this, since my crises have never involved life and death or the survival of the human race. But they are still crises."

Birch Bayh,life,"People are concerned, here again, about life, and haven't given a whole lot of attention to how you make fathers responsible for the lives they bring into the world."
August Strindberg,life,"People are constantly clamoring for the joy of life. As for me, I find the joy of life in the hard and cruel battle of life - to learn something is a joy to me."
Bow Wow,life,"People ask for this life, but they don't really understand what comes with it.

Carine Roitfeld,life,"People might think I'm very hard, what with my black make-up, my hair over my eyes, etc. My innocence didn't always help me, but it did preserve something in me that maybe others don't have anymore. I'm inside my bubble, you could say, and thankfully so, because I don't think daily life is always great. It protects me."
Caroline B. Cooney,life,"People nearly always believe, and are willing to back it up with weapons and cruelty, that their religion and way of life is better than the other person's."

Johann Gottfried Seume,life,People should always have something which they prefer to life.
Andy Warhol,life,"People sometimes say that the way things happen in the movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen to you in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television - you don't feel anything."
Ben Foster,life,"People tell me I look angry. I thought my dad was mad at me his whole life, but it turns out that was just his mug - and I inherited it."
Carrie-Anne Moss,life,"People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion. And then at a certain point, if you're lucky, you realize you can make up your own mind. Nobody sets the rules but you. You can design your own life."
Alice Walker,life,"People tend to think that life really does progress for everyone eventually, that people progress, but actually only some people progress. The rest of the people don't."
Bobby Bowden,life,"People that are brilliant and successful, we think they've just always been that way. That's not the case. Most of them have had some tough adversity in their life. It's prepared them. I've never felt like you could develop character without adversity."
Amy Tan,life,"People think it's a terrible tragedy when somebody has Alzheimer's. But in my mother's case, it's different. My mother has been unhappy all her life. For the first time in her life, she's happy."
Ann Druyan,life,"People think that if you are a scientist you have to give up that joy of discovery, that passion, that sense of the great romance of life. I say that's completely opposite of the truth."
Bo Bennett,life,People who come from dysfunctional families are not destined for a dysfunctional life.
Ben Elton,life,People who get through life dependent on other people's possessions are always the first to lecture you on how little possessions count.
Oscar Wilde,life,"People who love only once in their lives are shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failures."
Maxwell Maltz,life,"People who say that life is not worthwhile are really saying that they themselves have no personal goals which are worthwhile. Get yourself a goal worth working for. Better still, get yourself a project. Always have something ahead of you to ''look forward to'' - to work for and hope for."
Raoul Vaneigem,life,"People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints, such people have a corpse in their mouth."
Antonio Tabucchi,life,"People with lots of doubts sometimes find life more oppressive and exhausting than others, but they're more energetic - they aren't robots."
Edward Franklin Albee III,life,People would rather sleep their way through life than stay awake for it.
Barry Marshall,life,"Peptic ulcers became more common in the 20th century at the same time that these theories of Freud and other psychoanalysts became popular. And somehow those meshed, and this tradition emerged that ulcers were caused by stress or turmoil in one's life."
John Banville,life,Perhaps all of life is no more than a long preparation for the leaving of it.
Aldous Huxley,life,"Perhaps it's good for one to suffer. Can an artist do anything if he's happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?"
Joseph Conrad,life,Perhaps life is just that... a dream and a fear.
Bill Forsyth,life,"Perhaps naively I thought people understand what humor was, that it was invented by the human race to cope with the dark areas of life, problems and terrors."
Albert J. Nock,life,"Perhaps one reason for the falling-off of belief in a continuance of conscious existence is to be found in the quality of life that most of us lead. There is not much in it with which, in any kind of reason, one can associate the idea of immortality."
Jean Baudrillard,life,Perhaps our eyes are merely a blank film which is taken from us after our deaths to be developed elsewhere and screened as our life story in some infernal cinema or dispatched as microfilm into the sidereal void.
Brendan Myers,life,"Perhaps this is one of the last remaining strands of my Catholic upbringing, but to me the word 'worship' means absolute unquestioning affirmation of the authority of the deity. I'll not have that in my life. If you are wise, neither will you."
Arthur C. Clarke,life,"Perhaps, as some wit remarked, the best proof that there is Intelligent Life in Outer Space is the fact it hasn't come here. Well, it can't hide forever - one day we will overhear it."
Margaret Oliphant,life,"Perhaps, on the whole, embarrassment and perplexity are a kind of natural accompaniment to life and movement; and it is better to be driven out of your senses with thinking which of two things you ought to do than to do nothing whatever, and be utterly uninteresting to all the world."
Ben Stein,life,"Personal relationships are the fertile soil from which all advancement, all success, all achievement in real life grows."
Carl Sagan,life,"Personally, I would be delighted if there were a life after death, especially if it permitted me to continue to learn about this world and others, if it gave me a chance to discover how history turns out."
Thomas Hardy,life,"Pessimism is, in brief, playing the sure game. You cannot lose at it; you may gain. It is the only view of life in which you can never be disappointed. Having reckoned what to do in the worst possible circumstances, when better arise, as they may, life becomes child's play."
Alain de Botton,life,"Pick up any newspaper or magazine, open the TV, and you'll be bombarded with suggestions of how to have a successful life. Some of these suggestions are deeply unhelpful to our own projects and priorities - and we should take care."
Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,life,"Plunge boldly into the thick of life, and seize it where you will, it is always interesting."
Robert Frost,life,Poetry is a way of taking life by the throat.
William Hazlitt,life,Poetry is all that is worth remembering in life.
B. R. Ambedkar,life,"Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life."
Aristotle,life,"Politicians also have no leisure, because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself, power and glory, or happiness."
Bernard Crick,life,"Politics is too often regarded as a poor relation, inherently dependent and subsidiary; it is rarely praised as something with a life and character of its own."
Elbert Hubbard,life,Polygamy is an endeavor to get more out of life than there is in it.
Elbert Hubbard,life,"Polygamy: An endeavour to get more out of life than there is in it.,

Wilson Mizner,life,Popularity is exhausting. The life of the party almost always winds up in a corner with an overcoat over him.
Albert Einstein,life,"Possessions, outward success, publicity, luxury - to me these have always been contemptible. I assume that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best for both the body and the mind"
Henry Ward Beecher,life,"Poverty is very good in poems, but it is very bad in a house. It is very good in maxims and sermons, but it is very bad in practical life."
Samuel Smiles,life,"Practical wisdom is only to be learned in the school of experience. Precepts and instruction are useful so far as they go, but, without the discipline of real life, they remain of the nature of theory only."
Alexander Haig,life,"Practice rather than preach. Make of your life an affirmation, defined by your ideals, not the negation of others. Dare to the level of your capability then go beyond to a higher level."
C. Neil Strait,life,"Prayer is talking with God and telling Him you love Him, conversing with God about all the things that are important in life, both large and small, and being assured that He is listening."
Ralph Waldo Emerson,life,Preaching is the expression of moral sentiments applied to the duties of life.
Hosea Ballou,life,"Preaching is to much avail, but practice is far more effective. A godly life is the strongest argument you can offer the skeptic."
Seneca,life,Precepts or maxims are of great weight; and a few useful ones on hand do more to produce a happy life than the volumes we can't find.
Arthur E. Morgan,life,Preparation for old age should begin not later than one's teens. A life which is empty of purpose until 65 will not suddenly become filled on retirement.
Benjamin Netanyahu,life,"President Abbas, you've dedicated your life to advancing the Palestinian cause. Must this conflict continue for generations, or will we enable our children and our grandchildren to speak in years ahead of how we found a way to end it? That's what we should aim for, and that's what I believe we can achieve."
Ben Shapiro,life,President Obama and members of his administration constantly express rage and anger over events totally within their control. It's an odd and unsettling fact of American life that so many Americans seem to think that such expressions of frustration should substitute for actual competence.
Mary Kay Ash,life,"Pretend that every single person you meet has a sign around his or her neck that says, ''Make me feel important.'' Not only will you succeed in sales, you will succeed in life."
Blaise Pascal,life,"Pride takes such natural possession of us in the midst of our woes, errors, etc. We even lose our life with joy, provided people talk of it."
Bob Newhart,life,"Probably the best advice I ever got in my life was from the head of the accounting department, Mr. Hutchinson, I believe at the Glidden Company in Chicago, and he told me, 'You really aren't cut out for accounting.'"
Thomas Arnold,life,"Probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age, when the eager passions of youth are cooled, and the infirmities of age not yet begun; as we see that the shadows, which are at morning and evening so large, almost entirely disappear at midday."
Samuel Smiles,life,"Progress however, of the best kind, is comparatively slow. Great results cannot be achieved at once; and we must be satisfied to advance in life as we walk, step by step."
Karl Kraus,life,"Progress, under whose feet the grass mourns and the forest turns into paper from which newspaper plants grow, has subordinated the purpose of life to the means of subsistence and turned us into the nuts and bolts for our tools."
Anthony J. D'Angelo,life,Promise yourself to live your life as a revolution and not just a process of evolution.
Martin Luther King,life,"Property is intended to serve life, and no matter how much we surround it with rights and respect, it has no personal being. It is part of the earth man walks on. It is not man."
Wayne Dyer,life,Prosperity in the form of wealth works exactly the same as everything else. You will see it coming into your life when you are unattached to needing it.
Woodrow Wilson,life,Provision for others is a fundamental responsibility of human life.
Samuel Johnson,life,"Prudence is an attitude that keeps life safe, but does not often make it happy."
Samuel Johnson,life,"Prudence operates on life in the same manner as rule of composition; it produces vigilance rather than elevation; rather prevents loss than procures advantage; and often miscarriages, but seldom reaches either power or honor."
Bernard Malamud,life,"Prufrock had measured out his life with measuring spoons; Dubin, in books resurrecting the lives of others."
Dean William R. Inge,life,"Public opinion, a vulgar, impertinent, anonymous tyrant who deliberately makes life unpleasant for anyone who is not content to the average person."
John Berger,life,Publicity is the life of this culture. Without publicity capitalism could not survive and at the same time publicity is its dream.

John Updike,life,"Rain is grace; rain is the sky condescending to the earth; without rain, there would be no life."
Benny Green,life,"Ray had so much love of life and the music. He had so much integrity. He treated the music with so much dignity and respect. I spent four and a half years as a sideman with Ray Brown's trio. Music was his life, more so than anyone I could mention."
George Holbrook Jackson,life,"Read as you taste fruit or savor wine, or enjoy friendship, love or life."
Benjamin Disraeli,life,"Read no history: nothing but biography, for that is life without theory."
Mortimer J. Adler,life,Reading is a basic tool in the living of a good life.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau,life,"Reading, solitude, idleness, a soft and sedentary life, intercourse with women and young people, these are perilous paths for a young man, and these lead him constantly into danger."
Beau Willimon,life,"Real leaders have to live a paradoxical life, where they must break the rules in order to maintain them. If your expectations are high, you're setting yourself up for disillusionment. The land of governance is paved with gray streets, not black or white ones."
Bertrand Russell,life,"Real life is, to most men, a long second-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible; but the world of pure reason ;knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity."
Barbara Boxer,life,"Really, life is complicated enough without having a bunch of Senators deciding what we should do in the privacy of our own homes."
Aleksandr Solzjenitsyn,life,"Religion always remains higher than everyday life. In order to make the elevation towards religion easier for people, religion must be able to alter its forms in relation to the consciousness of modern man."
John Updike,life,Religion enables us to ignore nothingness and get on with the jobs of life.
Umberto Eco,life,"Religion has nothing to do with God. It's a fundamental attitude of human beings, who ask about the origins of life and what happens after death. For many, the answer is a personal god. In my opinion, it's religion that produces God, not the other way round."
Alan W. Watts,life,Religion is not a department of life; it is something that enters into the whole of it.
Paul Tillich,life,"Religion is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern, a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself contains the answer to the question of a meaning of our life."
John Galsworthy,life,"Religion was nearly dead because there was no longer real belief in future life; but something was struggling to take its place - service - social service - the ants creed, the bees creed."
Sir Walter Raleigh,life,"Remember if you marry for beauty, thou bindest thyself all thy life for that which perchance, will neither last nor please thee one year: and when thou hast it, it will be to thee of no price at all."

Marcus Aurelius,life,"Remember this, that there is a proper dignity and proportion to be observed in the performance of every act of life."
Wayne Dyer,life,"Remind yourself that the greatest technique for bringing peace into your life is to always choose being kind when you have a choice between being right or being kind.,

Linus Pauling,life,Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life.
Myriam Miedzian,life,Saving lives is not a top priority in the halls of power. Being compassionate and concerned about human life can cause a man to lose his job. It can cause a woman not to get the job to begin with.
Akhenaton,life,"Say not that honor is the child of boldness, nor believe thou that the hazard of life alone can pay the price of it: it is not to the action that it is due, but to the manner of performing it."
Ivan Illich,life,"School divides life into two segments, which are increasingly of comparable length. As much as anything else, schooling implies custodial care for persons who are declared undesirable elsewhere by the simple fact that a school has been built to serve them."

Adelaide Anne Procter,life,"Seated one day at the organ, I was weary and ill at ease, and my fingers wandered idly over the noisy keys. It seemed the harmonious echo from our discordant life."
Helen Keller,life,"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing."

Henry Ward Beecher,life,"See that each hour's feelings, and thoughts and actions are pure and true; then your life will be also."
Anne Cassidy,life,Seeing to it that a youngster grows up believing not just in the here and now but also in the grand maybes of life guarantees that some small yet crucial part of him remains forever a child.

Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,life,"Seldom in the business and transactions of ordinary life, do we find the sympathy we want."
Florence King,life,"Self-help books are making life downright unsafe. Women desperate to catch a man practice all the ploys recommended by these authors. Bump into him, trip over him, knock him down, spill something on him, scald him, but meet him."
Charles Lamb,life,"Separate from the pleasure of your company, I don't much care if I never see another mountain in my life."
Bill Frist,life,September 11 impressed upon us that life is a precious gift. Every life has a purpose. And I think we all have a duty to devote at least a small portion of our daily lives to ensuring that neither America nor the world ever forgets September 11.
Bryan Greenberg,life,"Seriously, my music really does help my acting, and, like, getting in and out of a character from a different lifestyle and writing a song about it. Likewise, my acting inspires the music because I can write a theme that I wouldn't necessarily approach at all in life."
Marian Wright Edelman,life,"Service is the rent we pay for being. It is the very purpose of life, and not something you do in your spare time."
Leonard Cohen,life,"Seven to eleven is a huge chunk of life, full of dulling and forgetting. It is fabled that we slowly lose the gift of speech with animals, that birds no longer visit our windowsills to converse. As our eyes grow accustomed to sight they armor themselves against wonder."
Gore Vidal,life,"Sex is. There is nothing more to be done about it. Sex builds no roads, writes no novels and sex certainly gives no meaning to anything in life but itself."
Alex Trebek,life,"Sex? Unfortunately, as you get older - and I shouldn't admit this - there are other things that become more important in your daily life."
Bjornstjerne Bjornson,life,"Shakespeare's plays were a great Teutonic Valhalla with brilliant sunshine at times and violent tempests at others. The world to him was a battlefield, but his sense of poetic justice, his sublime faith in life and its infinite resources, guided the battles."

Victor Hugo,life,"Short as life is, we make it still shorter by the careless waste of time."
Anthony Doerr,life,"Short stories are wonderful and extremely challenging, and the joy of them, because it only takes me three or four months to write, I can take more risks with them. It's just less of your life invested."

Ben Vereen,life,So be encouraged and dedicate yourself to your dream and if your dream should come my way one day then we will dance upon the boards of life.
Samuel Johnson,life,"So different are the colors of life, as we look forward to the future, or backward to the past; and so different the opinions and sentiments which this contrariety of appearance naturally produces, that the conversation of the old and young ends generally with contempt or pity on either side."
Caleb Carr,life,"So if it seems that some of what I'll have to say in the pages to come doesn't reflect the mellowing of age, that's only because I've never found that life and memories respond to time the way that tobacco does."
William Morris,life,"So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on, the degradation of the arts will go on; and if that system is to last for ever, then art is doomed, and will surely die; that is to say, civilization will die."

Benjamin Franklin,life,"So much for industry, my friends, and attention to one's own business; but to these we must add frugality if we would make our industry more certainly successful.

Benjamin Watson,life,"So much of football relates to Christian life - sacrifice, commitment, discipline."
Cornelius Nepos,life,"So that he seemed not to relinquish life, but to leave one home for another."
Allen Tate,life,"So the poet, who wants to be something that he cannot be, and is a failure in plain life, makes up fictitious versions of his predicament that are interesting even to other persons because nobody is a perfect automobile salesman."
Alan Thicke,life,"So there was a constant flow and a thin line there between reality and television and yes, much of what I was experiencing in my real life was also what was going on in the television show to the extent that I had to take writers' advice and from the counselors around."
Carrie Fisher,life,"So when I was 24, someone suggested to me that I was bipolar, and I thought that was ridiculous. I just thought he was trying to get out of treating me. But he was also responding to the chaotic nature of my life."
Barbara Ehrenreich,life,"So why do people keep on watching? The answer, by now, should be perfectly obvious: we love television because television brings us a world in which television does not exist. In fact, deep in their hearts, this is what the spuds crave most: a rich, new, participatory life."
Brit Morin,life,"Social life was different for me in college. I didn't go to as many parties as my friends did. I didn't join a sorority because I knew I couldn't make a long-term commitment. I was constantly traveling back and forth from Silicon Valley to Austin for internships. It was hard, but it was worth it for where I wanted to go."
Aldous Huxley,life,Societies are composed of individuals and are good only insofar as they help individuals to realize their potentialities and to lead a happy and creative life.

Cate Blanchett,life,"Some ideas, like what you're going to do with your life, take time to form."
Bob Lilly,life,"Some of the money going to the rookies can now be spent on people who have proved their worth. After all, the average playing life of a pro football player is about eight years and it is only fitting that the veterans get something for their efforts."
Barry Switzer,life,Some people are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple.
Berenice Abbott,life,"Some people are still unaware that reality contains unparalleled beauties. The fantastic and unexpected, the ever-changing and renewing is nowhere so exemplified as in real life itself."
Bill Shankly,life,Some people believe that football is a matter of life and death. I'm very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much more important than that.
Olive Schreiner,life,"Some people dare not feel fully, all life must be a long self-repression."
Bode Miller,life,"Some people say I make mistakes, I just say that in fact this is the secret of enjoying life. I hate monotony. Why don't they leave me freedom of choice? People want to impose choices which aren't necessarily mine. That's the mistake people make."
Burning Spear,life,"Some people see life as many steps up and try to forget where they are coming from, you understand? A little step in life on a commercial or a material level is a good step, but a big step does not mean a strong step - you tend to lose your roots - and if you don't be careful, you can fall."
Bill Shankly,life,Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I don't like that attitude. I can assure them it is much more serious than that.
Bill Flores,life,"Someday, somehow, the leadership of Planned Parenthood will have to answer for their callous disregard of the sanctity of human life. In the meantime, I am relieved that the Bryan abortion facility has gone out of business."

Carmen Busquets,life,Sometimes I make it to parties and sometimes I don't. Social life is always something you can go back to.
Ben Harper,life,"Sometimes I may be totally arrogant, sometimes I may totally be the most humble guy you've ever met, sometimes I may be in between. But that's life. Who isn't like that? What's the big deal if I had an arrogant moment."
Brenda Ueland,life,Sometimes I think of life as a process where everybody is discouraging and taking everybody else down a peg or two.
Bill Watterson,life,Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.
Vaclav Havel,life,Sometimes I wonder if suicides aren't in fact sad guardians of the meaning of life.
Carl Honore,life,"Sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life instead of the good life. And I think, for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness."
Steve Jobs,life,"Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.,
"
Brooke Elliott,life,"Sometimes someone that is the 'villain' in your life, when you look deeper and you think of what their issues are and why they behave like that and where they came from - they become less of a villain and more of someone that you can understand."
James Dillet Freeman,life,"Sometimes the answer to prayer is not that it changes life, but that it changes you."

Beck,life,"Sometimes things in life take a few years to digest, and they find their way into the work later on. Sometimes I'm writing about things from eight years ago-they just took a long time to distill and come out in the appropriate way."
Ben Vereen,life,"Sometimes we look for those thunderous things to happen in our life for our lives to change or go in the other direction. We seek the miracle. We seek the parting of the seas, the moving of the mountains. But no, it's a quiet thing. At least for me it was."
Caroline Wozniacki,life,"Sometimes when you get to the press conferences, you hear you're going to play this person in the semifinals, and in the quarters, you're going to play her. And I'm like, 'Hold on a second.' First of all, you have to make it there. Second, your opponent needs to make it there. It looks easier on paper than it is in real life."
Benny Goodman,life,"Sometimes when you start losing detail, whether it's in music or in life, something as small as failing to be polite, you start to lose substance."
Eleanor Roosevelt,life,"Somewhere along the line of development we discover what we really are, and then we make our real decision for which we are responsible. Make that decision primarily for yourself because you can never really live anyone else's life, not even your own child's."
Casey Wilson,life,"Somewhere along the way, I think I realised that taking yourself seriously is the worst thing that you can do in life, so once I let that go, I've just let it all go. I have no standard of personal dignity."

Lord George Byron,life,"Sorrow is knowledge, those that know the most must mourn the deepest, the tree of knowledge is not the tree of life."
Og Mandino,life,Sound character provides the power with which a person may ride the emergencies of life instead of being overwhelmed by them. Failure is... the highway to success.

Booker T. Washington,life,Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which one has overcome while trying to succeed.
Donald Rumsfeld,life,"Success tends to go not to the person who is error-free, because he also tends to be risk-averse. Rather it goes to the person who recognizes that life is pretty much a percentage business. It isn't making mistakes that's critical; it's correcting them and getting on with the principal task."
John Dewey,life,Such happiness as life is capable of comes from the full participation of all our powers in the endeavor to wrest from each changing situations of experience its own full and unique meaning.

Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,life,Superstition is the poetry of life.
Aldous Huxley,life,Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune of each of us would some day depend upon our winning or losing a game of chess.

Ben Affleck,life,"Sure, I suffered a lot. But it's not like the end of the world and it's not who I am. I lead quite a pleasant life and I'm able to divorce a perceived reality from my actual experience of life."

Ben Casnocha,life,Talk to people no one else is talking to.

That's luck. That's randomness.
Julie Burchill,life,"Tears are sometimes an inappropriate response to death. When a life has been lived completely honestly, completely successfully, or just completely, the correct response to death's perfect punctuation mark is a smile."
Freeman Dyson,life,"Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences."

Raymond Chandler,life,"The agent never receipts his bill, puts his hat on and bows himself out. He stays around forever, not only for as long as you can write anything that anyone will buy, but as long as anyone will buy any portion of any right to anything that you ever did write. He just takes ten per cent of your life."
Edmund White,life,"The AIDS epidemic has rolled back a big rotting log and revealed all the squirming life underneath it, since it involves, all at once, the main themes of our existence: sex, death, power, money, love, hate, disease and panic. No American phenomenon has been so compelling since the Vietnam War."

"
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,life,"The child is naturally meditative. He is a sort of samadhi; he's coming out of the womb of existence. His life river is yet absolutely fresh, just from the source. He knows the truth, but he does not know that he knows.... His knowledge is not yet aware. It is innocent. It is simply there, as a matter of fact. And he is not separate from his knowledge; he is his knowledge. He has not mind, he has simple being."
Billy Graham,life,"The Christian life is not a constant high. I have my moments of deep discouragement. I have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes, and say, 'O God, forgive me,' or 'Help me.'"
Jean-Luc Godard,life,"The cinema is not an art which films life: the cinema is something between art and life. Unlike painting and literature, the cinema both gives to life and takes from it, and I try to render this concept in my films. Literature and painting both exist as art from the very start; the cinema doesn't."
Carl Gustav Jung,life,"The cinema, like the detective story, makes it possible to experience without danger all the excitement, passion and desirousness which must be repressed in a humanitarian ordering of life."

Dwight D. Eisenhower,life,The clearest way to show what the rule of law means to us in everyday life is to recall what has happened when there is no rule of law.
Barney Frank,life,"The Clinton tax increase - which was an increase in taxes primarily on upper-income people - not only made the tax code more nearly progressive, it preceded one of the most productive economic periods in American life."
Earl Rochester,life,"The clog of all pleasure, the luggage of life, is the best can be said for a very good wife."
Arthur Miller,life,"The closer a man approaches tragedy the more intense is his concentration of emotion upon the fixed point of his commitment, which is to say the closer he approaches what in life we call fanaticism."

Joyce Meyer,life,"The conscience can be a strong guide in life if we allow it.,

Edwin Hubbel Chapin,life,"The creed of a true saint is to make the best of life, and to make the most of it."
Bruce Sutter,life,The Cubs gave me a chance to play. They signed me as a free agent and brought me to the Major Leagues. The first day I walked into Wrigley Field was one of the best days of my life. And I owe them an awful lot.

Annie Dillard,life,The dedicated life is worth living. You must give with your whole heart.
Alice Munro,life,"The deep, personal material of the latter half of your life is your children. You can write about your parents when they're gone, but your children are still going to be here, and you're going to want them to come and visit you in the nursing home."
Billy Corgan,life,"The deeper I get into my life as a musician, I'm discovering that it becomes less and less about other people, and more about what I want to do. And that's a good place to be."

Walter Benjamin,life,"The destructive character lives from the feeling, not that life is worth living, but that suicide is not worth the trouble."

Joseph A. Schumpeter,life,The evolution of the capitalist style of life could be easily - and perhaps most tellingly - described in terms of the genesis of the modern Lounge Suit.
Confucius,life,The expectations of life depend upon diligence; the mechanic that would perfect his work must first sharpen his tools.

E. M. Cioran,life,"The fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live - moreover, the only one."
Joan Didion,life,"The fancy that extraterrestrial life is by definition of a higher order than our own is one that soothes all children, and many writers."
Kabbalah,life,"The Father is the Giver of Life; but the Mother is the Giver of Death, because her womb is the gate of ingress to matter, and through her life is ensouled to form, and no form can be either infinite or eternal. Death is implicit in birth."
Kurt Vonnegut Jr,life,"The feeling about a soldier is, when all is said and done, he wasn't really going to do very much with his life anyway. The example usually is: ''he wasn't going to compose Beethoven's Fifth.''"
Beeban Kidron,life,"The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, 'Miracle in Milan.' It's a remarkable comment on slums, poverty and aspiration."

Pablo Casals,life,The first thing to do in life is to do with purpose what one purposes to do.
Margaret Oliphant,life,"The first thing which I can record concerning myself is, that I was born. These are wonderful words. This life, to which neither time nor eternity can bring diminution - this everlasting living soul, began. My mind loses itself in these depths."
Carl Hiaasen,life,"The Florida in my novels is not as seedy as the real Florida. It's hard to stay ahead of the curve. Every time I write a scene that I think is the sickest thing I have ever dreamed up, it is surpassed by something that happens in real life."
Jean Giraudoux,life,The flower is the poetry of reproduction. It is the example of the eternal seductiveness of life.
George Santayana,life,The fly that prefers sweetness to a long life may drown in honey.

Robert F. Kennedy,life,"The free way of life proposes ends, but it does not prescribe means."
Julie Burchill,life,"The freedom that women were supposed to have found in the Sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion; things to make life easier for men, in fact."
Bernard Montgomery,life,The frightful casualties appalled me. The so-called good fighting generals of the war appeared to me to be those who had a complete disregard for human life. There were of course exceptions and I suppose one was Plumer; I had only once seen him and I had never spoken to him.
Gilbert K. Chesterton,life,"The full value of this life can only be got by fighting; the violent take it by storm. And if we have accepted everything we have missed something - war. This life of ours is a very enjoyable fight, but a very miserable truce."
Albert Einstein,life,"The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge."

Michael Jordan,life,"The game is my life. It demands loyalty and responsibility, and it gives me back fulfillment and peace."
Florence Scovel Shinn,life,"The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy."
Wallace Stevens,life,"The genuine artist is never ''true to life.'' He sees what is real, but not as we are normally aware of it. We do not go storming through life like actors in a play. Art is never real life."
George Borrow,life,"The Germans are the most philosophic people in the world, and the greatest smokers: now I trace their philosophy to their smoking. Smoking has a sedative effect upon the nerves, and enables a man to bear the sorrows of this life (of which every one has his share) not only decently, but dignifiedly."

John Morley,life,"The great business of life is to be, to do, to do without and to depart."
Voltaire,life,The great consolation in life is to say what one thinks.
Carl Jung,life,The great decisions of human life usually have far more to do with the instincts and other mysterious unconscious factors than with conscious will and well-meaning reasonableness.

Thomas Henry Huxley,life,The great end of life is not knowledge but action.
Oscar Wilde,life,"The great events of life often leave one unmoved; they pass out of consciousness, and, when one thinks of them, become unreal. Even the scarlet flowers of passion seem to grow in the same meadow as the poppies of oblivion."
Boris Pasternak,life,"The great majority of us are required to live a life of constant duplicity. Your health is bound to be affected if, day after day, you say the opposite of what you feel, if you grovel before what you dislike, and rejoice at what brings you nothing but misfortune. Our nervous system isn't just a fiction, it's a part of our physical body, and our soul exists in space, and is inside us, like the teeth in our mouth. It can't be forever violated with impunity."
Kate Millet,life,The great mass of women throughout history have been confined to the cultural level of animal life in providing the male with sexual outlet and exercising the animal functions of reproduction and care of the young.
David Sarnoff,life,The great menace to the life of an industry is industrial self-complacency.
Caleb Deschanel,life,"The great photographers of life - like Diane Arbus and Walker Evans and Robert Frank - all must have had some special quality: a personality of nurturing and non-judgment that frees the subjects to reveal their most intimate reality. It really is what makes a great photographer, every bit as much as understanding composition and lighting."
Carl Jung,life,"The great problems of life, including of course sex, are always related to the primordial images of the collective unconscious. These images are balancing and compensating factors that correspond to the problems which life confronts us with in reality. This is not matter for astonishment, since these images are deposits of thousands of years of experience of the struggle for existence and for adaptation."
Albert Schweitzer,life,The great secret of success is to go through life as a man who never gets used up.

,
"
Victor Hugo,life,"The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved, loved for ourselves, or rather loved in spite of ourselves."
Benjamin Clementine,life,"The greatest in heroes in life are the anonymous. That's what I believe. Your neighbours are heroes. People who, when you walk down the street, you see them feeding their little baby - these people are heroes because they are living under difficult situations, but they're still trying to save a life."
R.D. Clyde,life,The greatest joy of life is to love and be loved.

Mychal Wynn,life,The greatest quest in life is to reach one's potential.

Gilbert K. Chesterton,life,The greenhorn is the ultimate victor in everything; it is he that gets the most out of life.
George Eliot,life,"The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistorical acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs."
Alfred N. Whitehead,life,"The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be, seek simplicity and distrust it."
Brendan Gill,life,"The guns of the big events rumble through our pages, but the tiny firecrackers are constantly hissing and popping there as well; it appears that much of my life as a journalist has been devoted to sedulously setting off firecrackers."
Thomas Jefferson,life,The happiest moments of my life have been the few which I have passed at home in the bosom of my family.
Samuel Johnson,life,The happiest part of a man's life is what he passes lying awake in bed in the morning.

Ben Horowitz,life,"The hardest thing about starting a company and running a company is, there's just so many expectations on you, and there are so many people who have things that they want you to do. It's a lot like life about that."
David Russell,life,The hardest thing in life is to know which bridge to cross and which to burn.
Helen Hayes,life,The hardest years in life are those between ten and seventy.

Felix Adler,life,"The hero is one who kindles a great light in the world, who sets up blazing torches in the dark streets of life for men to see by."
St. Thomas Aquinas,life,The highest manifestation of life consists in this: that a being governs its own actions. A thing which is always subject to the direction of another is somewhat of a dead thing.

Charles Péguy,life,"The honest man must be a perpetual renegade, the life of an honest man a perpetual infidelity. For the man who wishes to remain faithful must take himself perpetually unfaithful to all the continual, successive, indefatigable, renascent errors."
Aldous Huxley,life,The horror no less than the charm of real life consists precisely in the recurrent actualization of the inconceivable.
Hannah Arendt,life,"The human condition is such that pain and effort are not just symptoms which can be removed without changing life itself; they are the modes in which life itself, together with the necessity to which it is bound, makes itself felt. For mortals, the ''easy life of the gods'' would be a lifeless life."
Eliza Farnham,life,"The human face is the organic seat of beauty. It is the register of value in development, a record of Experience, whose legitimate office is to perfect the life, a legible language to those who will study it, of the majestic mistress, the soul."
Charles Horton Cooley,life,"The human mind is indeed a cave swarming with strange forms of life, most of them unconscious and unilluminated. Unless we can understand something as to how the motives that issue from this obscurity are generated, we can hardly hope to foresee or control them."
John W. Gardner,life,The idea for which this nation stands will not survive if the highest goal free man can set themselves is an amiable mediocrity. Excellence implies striving for the highest standards in every phase of life.
Alan Cranston,life,"The idea of being a foreign correspondent and wandering the world and witnessing great events, having adventures and covering the activities of world leaders, appealed to me greatly. It was a very glamorous life in those days."
Charles Horton Cooley,life,The idea that seeing life means going from place to place and doing a great variety of obvious things is an illusion natural to dull minds.
Anna Howard Shaw,life,"The idealists dream and the dream is told, and the practical men listen and ponder and bring back the truth and apply it to human life, and progress and growth and higher human ideals come into being and so the world moves ever on."
Albert Einstein,life,"The ideas that have lighted my way and, time after time, have given me new courage to face life cheerfully have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth."
Carl Gustav Jung,life,"The images of the unconscious place a great responsibility upon a man. Failure to understand them, or a shirking of ethical responsibility, deprives him of his wholeness and imposes a painful fragmentariness on his life."
John Keats,life,"The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness."
Glenda Jackson,life,"The important thing in acting is to be able to laugh and cry. If I have to cry I think of my sex life. If I have to laugh, I think of my sex life."
Barbara Kingsolver,life,"The important thing isn't the house. It's the ability to make it. You carry that in your brains and in your hands, wherever you go... It's one thing to carry your life wherever you go. Another thing to always go looking for it somewhere else."
Sigmund Freud,life,"The impression forces itself upon one that men measure by false standards, that everyone seeks power, success, riches for himself, and admires others who attain them, while undervaluing the truly precious thing in life."
Charles A. Lindbergh,life,"The improvement of our way of life is more important than the spreading of it. If we make it satisfactory enough, it will spread automatically. If we do not, no strength of arms can permanently oppose it."
Arthur Middleton,life,"The Incarnation is the medicine of the soul, undoing the Fall and bringing man to the Tree of Life, and the office of a priest is to administer this medicine in the sacraments."
Logan Pearsall Smith,life,The indefatigable pursuit of an unattainable perfection -even though nothing more than the pounding of an old piano -is what alone gives a meaning to our life on this unavailing star.
Ben Stein,life,The indispensable first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: Decide what you want.
William B. Yeats,life,"The intellect of man is forced to choose perfection of the life, or of the work, and if it take the second must refuse a heavenly mansion, raging in the dark."
Virginia Woolf,life,"The interest in life does not lie in what people do, nor even in their relations to each other, but largely in the power to communicate with a third party, antagonistic, enigmatic, yet perhaps persuadable, which one may call life in general."
Friedrich Nietzsche,life,"The invalid is a parasite on society. In a certain state it is indecent to go on living. To vegetate on in cowardly dependence on physicians and medicaments after the meaning of life, the right to life, has been lost ought to entail the profound contempt of society."
Candace Bushnell,life,"The joke that I make is that there are instances on the TV series that happen to me, - except on Sex and the City they always make it better or worse than real life and I am actually saying that in a joking way."
Barbara de Angelis,life,The journey between what you once were and who you are now becoming is where the dance of life really takes place.
George Bernard Shaw,life,The joy in life is to be used for a purpose. I want to be used up when I die.
Barbara Corcoran,life,"The joy is in the getting there. The beginning years of starting your business, the camaraderie when you're in the pit together, are the best years of your life. So rather than being so focused on when you get big and powerful, if you can just get the juice out of that... don't miss it."
Aleister Crowley,life,"The joy of life consists in the exercise of one's energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience. To stop means simply to die. The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal."

Earl Nightingale,life,"The key that unlocks energy is ''Desire.'' It's also the key to a long and interesting life. If we expect to create any drive, any real force within ourselves, we have to get excited."
Bette Davis,life,"The key to life is accepting challenges. Once someone stops doing this, he's dead."

Ben Shapiro,life,"The Left despises Texas, with its stellar record of job growth; Texas, with its strong support for traditional marriage and the sanctity of life; Texas, the root of the conservative tree.

Wilferd Arlan Peterson,life,"The wise man realistically accepts as part of life and builds a philosophy to meet them and make the most of them. He lives on the principle of ''nothing attempted, nothing gained'' and is resolved that if he fails he is going to fail while trying to succeed."
Florence King,life,"The witty woman is a tragic figure in American life. Wit destroys eroticism and eroticism destroys wit, so women must choose between taking lovers and taking no prisoners."

Richard Marcinko,life,"We all knew there was just one way to improve our odds for survival: train, train, train. Sometimes, if your training is properly intense it will kill you. More often - much, much more often - it will save your life."
Ben Gibbard,life,"We all pine for a time in life when things were simpler. Even when they weren't necessarily simpler, hindsight makes them look a lot simpler. The reality of it was that it wasn't."
Benjamin Clementine,life,"We always blame other people when things go wrong. For example, family to friends, you think they'll stay by your side, and you realise they never do. But that's life."
John Donne,life,"We are all conceived in close prison; in our mothers wombs, we are close prisoners all; when we are born, we are born but to the liberty of the house; prisoners still, though within larger walls; and then all our life is but a going out to the place of execution, to death."

Earl Nightingale,life,"We are at our very best, and we are happiest, when we are fully engaged in work we enjoy on the journey toward the goal we've established for ourselves. It gives meaning to our time off and comfort to our sleep. It makes everything else in life so wonderful, so worthwhile."

Hubert H. Humphrey,life,"We are in danger of making our cities places where business goes on but where life, in its real sense, is lost."
John Steinbeck,life,"We are lonesome animals. We spend all our life trying to be less lonesome. One of our ancient methods is to tell a story begging the listener to say - and to feel - ''Yes, that's the way it is, or at least that's the way I feel it. You're not as alone as you thought.''"
Billy Childish,life,"We are not actually in charge of life, yet behave as if we are the masters of our own destiny. The realization of this fact is quite a hard one. The ridiculousness of our pomposity and presumption can only result in anger or humor."
Alain de Botton,life,"We are properly ready for marriage when we are strong enough to embrace a life of frustration.,
"
William Shakespeare,life,"We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life, is rounded with a sleep."

Ray Bradbury,life,We are the miracle of force and matter making itself over into imagination and will. Incredible. The Life Force experimenting with forms. You for one. Me for another. The Universe has shouted itself alive. We are one of the shouts.

William B. Yeats,life,We begin to live when we have conceived life as tragedy.
Thomas Carlyle,life,"We call it a Society; and go about professing openly the totalest separation, isolation. Our life is not a mutual helpfulness; but rather, cloaked under due laws-of-war, named ''fair competition'' and so forth, it is a mutual hostility."
Plato,life,We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.

James Baldwin,life,"We cannot discuss the state of our minorities until we first have a sense of what we are, who we are, what our goals are, and what we take life to be."
A. J. Muste,life,"We cannot have peace if we are only concerned with peace. War is not an accident. It is the logical outcome of a certain way of life. If we want to attack war, we have to attack that way of life."
Joseph Fort Newton,life,"We cannot tell what may happen to us in the strange medley of life. But we can decide what happens in us - how we can take it, what we do with it - and that is what really counts in the end. How to take the raw stuff of life and make it a thing of worth and beauty - that is the test of living."

Michel Eyquem De Montaigne,life,"We endeavor more that men should speak of us, than how and what they speak, and it sufficeth us that our name run in men's mouths, in what manner soever. It stemma that to be known is in some sort to have life and continuance in other men's keeping."

Edwin Markham,life,We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.
Lewis Mumford,life,"We have created an industrial order geared to automatism, where feeble-mindedness, native or acquired, is necessary for docile productivity in the factory; and where a pervasive neurosis is the final gift of the meaningless life that issues forth at the other end."
William James,life,"We have grown literally afraid to be poor. We despise anyone who elects to be poor in order to simplify and save his inner life. If he does not join the general scramble and pant with the money-making street, we deem him spiritless and lacking in ambition."
Norman Cousins,life,We have learned to live in a world of mistakes and defective products as if they were necessary to life. It is time to adopt a new philosophy in America.
Walter Benjamin,life,"We have long forgotten the ritual by which the house of our life was erected. But when it is under assault and enemy bombs are already taking their toll, what enervated, perverse antiquities do they not lay bare in the foundations."
Sigmund Freud,life,"We have long observed that every neurosis has the result, and therefore probably the purpose, of forcing the patient out of real life, of alienating him from actuality."
David Herbert Lawrence,life,"We have lost the art of living; and in the most important science of all, the science of daily life, the science of behavior, we are complete ignoramuses. We have psychology instead."
Charles Horton Cooley,life,We have no higher life that is really apart from other people. It is by imagining them that our personality is built up; to be without the power of imagining them is to be a low-grade idiot.
Abdul Kalam,life,"We have not invaded anyone. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them."
Ban Ki-moon,life,"We have reached a new milestone as a human family. With seven billion of us now inhabiting our planet, it is time to ask some fundamental questions. How can we provide a dignified life for ourselves and future generations while preserving and protecting the global commons - the atmosphere, the oceans and the ecosystems that support us?"
Asa Gray,life,We have spoken of beings so low in the scale that the individuals throughout their whole existence are not sufficiently specialized to be distinctively plant or animal: yet these are definite life in simpler shape.

Anton Chekhov,life,"We learn about life not from plusses alone, but from minuses as well."
Orison Swett Marden,life,"We lift ourselves by our thought. We climb upon our vision of ourselves. If you want to enlarge your life, you must first enlarge your thought of it and of yourself. Hold the ideal of yourself as you long to be, always everywhere."
Aaron Sorkin,life,"We live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You?... You can't handle it. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty. We use these words as a backbone to a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the "
Brooke Shields,life,"We live in New York. To be able to have a steady job and take your kids to school, and be around and work hard, is the perfect life."
Martha Graham,life,"We look at the dance to impart the sensation of living in an affirmation of life, to energize the spectator into keener awareness of the vigor, the mystery, the humor, the variety, and the wonder of life. This is the function of the American dance."

"
Norman Macewan,life,"we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give."
David Herbert Lawrence,life,"We make a mistake forsaking England and moving out into the periphery of life.

Ida R. Wylie,life,"We must accept life for what it actually is - a challenge to our quality without which we should never know of what stuff we are made, or grow to our full stature."
Edward M. Forster,life,"We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us."

Eric Hoffer,life,We need not only a purpose in life to give meaning to our existence but also something to give meaning to our suffering. We need as much something to suffer for as something to live for.
Ben Carson,life,"We need to find ways to elevate the expectations, particularly of those individuals who may start off on a lower socioeconomic rung, who might be seen as disadvantaged.

Stephen Hawking,life,We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet.

Bernard Lown,life,"We physicians who shepherd human life from birth to death have a moral imperative to resist with all our being the drift toward the brink. The threatened inhabitants on this fragile planet must speak out for those yet unborn, for posterity has no lobby with politicians."
Oscar Wilde,life,"We quaff the cup of life with eager haste without draining it, instead of which it only overflows the brim - objects press around us, filling the mind with the throng of desires that wait upon them, so that we have no room for the thoughts of death."
David Mamet,life,We respond to a drama to that extent to which it corresponds to our dream life.
Bill Cosby,life,"We see a successful, elegant man now, but as a child, an adolescent, his life was not a done deal. Sidney respected his mistakes. When failure came, he never said, This is too difficult, too hard, he had the resiliency to try again. His life is somewhere between astounding and unbelievable."
Barbara Demick,life,"We see North Koreans as automatons, goose-steeping at parades, doing mass gymnastics with fixed smiles on their faces - but beneath all that, real life goes on with the same complexity of human emotion as anywhere else."
Marlin Finch Lupus,life,"We seek the comfort of another. Someone to share and share the life we choose. Someone to help us through the never-ending attempt to understand ourselves. And in the end, someone to comfort us along the way."

Marcus Tullius Cicero,life,We think a happy life consists in tranquility of mind.
Mohsin Hamid,life,"We think of the romance novel as a lesser form of literature, but I don't think that's true. Love is a very important aspect of human life and worth exploring."
Bonnie Tyler,life,"We were brought up Protestant, and I went to church three times a day on a Sunday. My parents weren't Bible-bashers, but we all have a strong belief in God and a strong faith. We had a huge garden; our house was a bit like a scene from 'The Good Life.' I think Mam and Dad had it really hard, bringing up a big family on very little."
Barbara Ehrenreich,life,We who officially value freedom of speech above life itself seem to have nothing to talk about but the weather.
Adam Schiff,life,We will not let terrorists change our way of life; we will not live in fear; and we will not undermine the civil liberties that characterize our Democracy.

Bill Murray,life,"We're born alone. We do need each other. It's lonely to really effectively live your life, and anyone you can get help from or give help to; that's part of your obligation."

Henry David Thoreau,life,Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.
Sean O'Casey,life,"Wealth often takes away chances from men as well as poverty. There is none to tell the rich to go on striving, for a rich man makes the law that hallows and hollows his own life."
Anthony Holden,life,"Well I'm a very similar age to Prince Charles. I'm a year older than him. I was at university at the same time as him. I think in the sixties, like all the Royals, he really had very little impact on my life at all and he seemed, if anything a lot older in his attitudes."
Candace Bushnell,life,"Well in the book Carrie was my alter ego. In real life, Sarah Jessica and I don't look anything alike. But people do say that we sound alike. Sarah Jessica is an adorable girl and she is very funny."
Ann Beattie,life,"Well, a few years ago I think I could have given you a more enthusiastic answer about that but in the last few years, for the first time in my life, I really haven't listened to much music. I used to work with music on and now I don't."

Bill Scott,life,"Well, I think that those of us in public life that are trying to do a good job, and that are faced with this popular new game that the media has of being critical of everything that anybody in public office does probably are thin-skinned."
Bobby Farrelly,life,"Well, there are conjoined twins in real life and we can tell a story about them so long as they're not the brunt of the jokes. In this, they're the heroes of this story; we love these guys."
Bryn Terfel,life,"Welsh is my mother tongue, and my children speak it. If you come and live in this community you'll work out pretty quickly that it's beneficial to learn the language, because if you're going to the pub or a cafe you need to be a part of the local life."
Jose Ortega Y Gasset,life,"Were art to redeem man, it could do so only by saving him from the seriousness of life and restoring him to an unexpected boyishness."

John Masefield,life,"What am I, Life? A thing of watery salt held in cohesion by unresting cells. Which work they know not why, which never halt, myself unwitting where their Master dwells?"
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps,life,"What an immense power over the life is the power of possessing distinct aims. The voice, the dress, the look, the very motion of a person, define and alter when he or she begins to live for a reason."
Elizabeth Bishop,life,"What childishness is it that while there's breath of life in our bodies, we are determined to rush to see the sun the other way around?"

George Eliot,life,What do we live for; if it is not to make life less difficult to each other?
Joseph Campbell,life,"What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else."
William Somerset Maugham,life,"What has influenced my life more than any other single thing has been my stammer. Had I not stammered I would probably... have gone to Cambridge as my brothers did, perhaps have become a don and every now and then published a dreary book about French literature."
Audre Lorde,life,What I leave behind has a life of its own.
Bruce Eric Kaplan,life,What I like about graduation speeches is that they're an opportunity for someone to make sense of their life and to impart that wisdom to someone else. It's like a sanctioned self-help moment.

Bonnie Blair,life,"What I've learned from my own journey, and from my family's experience with cancer, is how important it is to stay positive and move forward. Not every day is going to be perfect; that's life. But staying positive is going to get you to the next day."

Carl Jung,life,What is essential in a work of art is that it should rise far above the realm of personal life and speak to the spirit and heart of the poet as man to the spirit and heart of mankind.

Boris Pasternak,life,"What is laid down, ordered, factual is never enough to embrace the whole truth: life always spills over the rim of every cup."

Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,life,What is my life if I am no longer useful to others.

Joseph Brodsky,life,What should I say about life? That it's long and abhors transparence.
Marcus Tullius Cicero,life,"What sweetness is left in life, if you take away friendship? Robbing life of friendship is like robbing the world of the sun. A true friend is more to be esteemed than kinsfolk."

Leo Buscaglia,life,What we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life.
Bob Taft,life,"What we don't talk about enough is Ohio's unique and remarkable quality of life. We are a state of cities, small towns and growing suburbs where life is affordable and destinations within reach. There is no better place to raise a family."

Sydney Smith,life,"What would life be without arithmetic, but a scene of horrors?"

Alexander Pope,life,"What's fame? a fancy'd life in other's breath. A thing beyond us, even before our death."
Julia Roberts,life,"What's nice about my dating life is that I don't have to leave my house. All I have to do is read the paper: I'm marrying Richard Gere, dating Daniel Day-Lewis, parading around with John F. Kennedy, Jr., and even Robert De Niro was in there for a day."
Satchel Paige,life,"What's scary in life is not what people know (or don't know), but what they know that ain't so."

"
Simone Weil,life,"When a man's life is destroyed or damaged by some wound or privation of soul or body, which is due to other men's actions or negligence, it is not only his sensibility that suffers but also his aspiration toward the good. Therefore there has been sacrilege towards that which is sacred in him."

Bonnie Bassler,life,"When antibiotics became industrially produced following World War II, our quality of life and our longevity improved enormously. No one thought bacteria were going to become resistant."

Ben Nicholson,life,"When I left school I went on trip around the world - I only got as far as Australia, but like a bloody fool I cut it short because of a girl. It's probably one of my big regrets in life."

Ang Lee,life,"When I sent those scripts, that was the lowest point of my life. We'd just had our second son, and when I went to collect them from hospital, I went to the bank to try and get some money to buy some diapers, the screen showed I've got $26 left."
Erma Bombeck,life,"When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say, ''I used everything you gave me.''."
Agnes Martin,life,When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection.
Herman Melville,life,"When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without - oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!"
Boris Becker,life,"When I was a child, I had posters of James Dean in my room. I was a big admirer of his work and was fascinated by him living on the edge. Looking back, my life was kind of the same."
Bruce Forsyth,life,"When I was a child, life felt so slow because all I wanted to do was get into show business. Each day seemed like a year, but when you get older, years pass like minutes. I wish there was a tape recorder where we could just slow our lives down."
Buzz Aldrin,life,"When I was a little kid, we only knew about our nine planets. Since then, we've downgraded Pluto but have discovered that other solar systems and stars are common. So life is probably quite prevalent."

Agnetha Faltskog,life,"When I'm living in the world of luxury and celebrity, which is where I found myself for a large part of my life, it's a walk-on part. Not a vital necessity, like it is for so many people. I enjoy it but I can see right through it!."

Bipasha Basu,life,"When things have gone really wrong in my life, I've cried like a child. I have really, really cried. I cry it out. Two-three days I cry, and then I'm like, enough, time to deal with reality and figure a way out. This is the way I have dealt with everything."
Bjorn Lomborg,life,"When thinking about the future, it is fashionable to be pessimistic. Yet the evidence unequivocally belies such pessimism.

Marcus Aurelius,life,"When thou art above measure angry, bethink thee how momentary is man's life."

Jack Kornfield,life,"When we come into the present, we begin to feel the life around us again, but we also encounter whatever we have been avoiding.

Carolyn Chute,life,"Whenever I write, I write what I find to be the way people are. I never use any symbolism at all, but if you write as true to life as you possibly can, people will see symbolism. They'll all see different symbolism, but they're apt to because you can see it in life."

Barbara Kingsolver,life,"Why does a person even get up in the morning? You have breakfast, you floss your teeth so you'll have healthy gums in your old age, and then you get in your car and drive down I-10 and die. Life is so stupid I can't stand it."

Francoise Sagan,life,"Writing is a question of finding a certain rhythm. I compare it to the rhythms of jazz. Much of the time life is a sort of rhythmic progression of three characters. If one tells oneself that life is like that, one feels it less arbitrary."
Ahmed Ben Bella,life,"Yes, my life is a life of combat; I can say that this has never stopped for a single instant. It is a combat that started for me at the age of 16. I'm 90 years old now, and my motivation hasn't changed; it's the same fervour that drives me."

Les Brown,life,You don't get in life what you want; you get in life what you are.
Bill Bryson,life,"You don't have to know anything about baseball to respond to Babe Ruth because he's just this magnificent human being.

Bill Burr,life,"You know, it wasn't even that I'm a funny guy, I just loved stand-up comedy and I wanted to do it. It was one of the few things in my life that I knew I was going to be able to do, and I also felt as though I'd be able to do it the way I wanted to do it."

William Wordsworth,life,"… with an eye made by quite by power of harmony, and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things."
Charles Horton Cooley,life,"''I'' is a militant social tendency, working to hold and enlarge its place in the general current of tendencies. So far as it can it waxes, as all life does.

Jean de la Bruyère,life,"A bachelor's life is a fine breakfast, a flat lunch, and a miserable dinner."
Lewis Mumford,life,"A day spent without the sight or sound of beauty, the contemplation of mystery, or the search of truth or perfection is a poverty-stricken day; and a succession of such days is fatal to human life."

Greg Anderson,life,"The perfect no-stress environment is the grave. When we change our perception we gain control. The stress becomes a challenge, not a threat. When we commit to action, to actually doing something rather than feeling trapped by events, the stress in our life becomes manageable."
Andre Breton,life,"The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal."
Bernard Mandeville,life,"There is no intrinsic worth in money but what is alterable with the times, and whether a guinea goes for twenty pounds or for a shilling, it is the labor of the poor and not the high and low value that is set on gold or silver, which all the comforts of life must arise from."

George Orwell,human,"As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me."
Barry Unsworth,human,As I wrote I began to see more strongly that there were inescapable analogies.

Brin-Jonathan Butler,human,"Boxing distills and illuminates the essence of an athlete. There's nowhere to hide. Boxers live and perform at the extremes.

Henry James,human,Cats and monkeys; monkeys and cats; all human life is there.

Phyllis Mcginley,human,"Gossip isn't scandal and it's not merely malicious. It's chatter about the human race by lovers of the same. Gossip is the tool of the poet, the shop-talk of the scientist, and the consolation of the housewife, wit, tycoon and intellectual. It begins in the nursery and ends when speech is past."
Ann Veneman,human,"Great Britain had a much different situation than we do and did here in the United States, in that they had literally thousands of infected animals with human health risks. Their infectivity in this disease happened before very much was known about it."
Elizabeth Janeway,human,"Growing up human is uniquely a matter of social relations rather than biology. What we learn from connections within the family takes the place of instincts that program the behavior of animals; which raises the question, how good are these connections?"

Alexis Carrel,human,Hard conditions of life are indispensable to bringing out the best in human personality.

Bill Nye,human,"History is but the record of the public and official acts of human beings.

Iris Murdoch,human,"Human affairs are not serious, but they have to be taken seriously."
Abraham J. Heschel,human,"Human being is both being in the world and living in the world. Living involves responsible understanding of one's role in relation to all other beings.

David Mitchell,human,I think the story is the most ancient form of human entertainment.
William S. Burroughs,human,I think there are innumerable gods. What we on earth call God is a little tribal God who has made an awful mess. Certainly forces operating through human consciousness control events.

George Eliot,human,"If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the best of us walk about well wadded with stupidity."
Freeman Dyson,human,"If we had a reliable way to label our toys good and bad, it would be easy to regulate technology wisely. But we can rarely see far enough ahead to know which road leads to damnation. Whoever concerns himself with big technology, either to push it forward or to stop it, is gambling in human lives."
Eleanor Roosevelt,human,"If we want a free and peaceful world, if we want to make the deserts bloom and man grow to greater dignity as a human being-we can do it."

Barry Commoner,human,"If you ask what you are going to do about global warming, the only rational answer is to change the way in which we do transportation, energy production, agriculture and a good deal of manufacturing.

Bill Goldberg,human,"If you don't want to investigate what you're passing judgment on, then it's your fault. And I believe that if people investigate Goldberg as a human being, I'm not such a bad guy."
Billy Joel,human,"If you make music for the human needs you have within yourself, then you do it for all humans who need the same things. You enrich humanity with the profound expression of these feelings."

Gabriel Heatter,human,"If you were happy every day of your life you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host."

Bill Flores,human,"Imagine having all of your freedoms taken away, being forced to work against your will, and constantly living under the threat of violence - in short, being forced to live as a slave. Sadly, this situation is a reality for millions of children, women, and men each year as part of the global human trafficking industry."
Euripides,human,Impudence is the worst of all human diseases.
Barney Frank,human,In a free society a large degree of human activity is none of the government's business. We should make criminal what's going to hurt other people and other than that we should leave it to people to make their own choices.
Bob Barr,human,"In a single generation, the Internet has given to virtually every person on the face of the earth the ability to communicate with fellow human beings on virtually any topic, at any time, and in every nook and cranny on the globe.

Ambrose Bierce,human,"In each human heart are a tiger, a pig, an ass and a nightingale. Diversity of character is due to their unequal activity."
George Santayana,human,"In endowing us with memory, nature has revealed to us a truth utterly unimaginable to the unreflective creation, the truth of immortality. The most ideal human passion is love, which is also the most absolute and animal and one of the most ephemeral."
Carl Sagan,human,"In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness."
Albert Schweitzer,human,"In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit."
Bruce Dern,human,"In Hitchcock's eyes the movement was dramatic, not the acting. When he wanted the audience to be moved, he moved the camera. He was a subtle human being, and he was also the best director I have ever worked with."
Plutarch,human,"In human life there is constant change of fortune; and it is unreasonable to expect an exemption from the common fate. Life itself decays, and all things are daily changing."

Richard Whately,human,"In our judgment of human transactions, the law of optics is reversed, we see most dimly the objects which are close around us."
Bruce Lipton,human,"In reality, a cell is a biological mini-me compared to the human body. A cell has every biological system that you have."

Alexander Hamilton,human,"In the general course of human nature, A power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will."
Francois de la Rochefoucauld,human,In the human heart new passions are forever being born; the overthrow of one almost always means the rise of another.

H. A. Kramers,human,"In the world of human thought generally, and in physical science particularly, the most important and fruitful concepts are those to which it is impossible to attach a well-defined meaning."
Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle,human,"In vain we shall penetrate more and more deeply the secrets of the structure of the human body, we shall not dupe nature; we shall die as usual."
Haniel Long,human,"In youth the human body drew me and was the object of my secret and natural dreams. But body after body has taken away from me that sensual phosphorescence which my youth delighted in. Within me is no disturbing interplay now, but only the steady currents of adaptation and of sympathy."
Robert Browning,human,"Inscribe all human effort with one word, artistry's haunting curse, the Incomplete!"
Charles Horton Cooley,human,"Institutions - government, churches, industries, and the like - have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom; and in so far as they fail, on the whole, to perform this function, they are wrong and need reconstruction."

Bette Davis,human,"It has been my experience that one cannot, in any shape or form, depend on human relations for lasting reward. It is only work that truly satisfies."
Lord George Byron,human,"It has been said that the immortality of the soul is a ''grand peut-''tre'' - but still it is a grand one. Everybody clings to it -the stupidest, and dullest, and wickedest of human bipeds is still persuaded that he is immortal."
Anthony de Mello,human,"It is a great mystery that though the human heart longs for Truth, in which alone it finds liberation and delight, the first reaction of human beings to Truth is one of hostility and fear!"
Charles Dickens,human,"It is a pleasant thing to reflect upon, and furnishes a complete answer to those who contend for the gradual degeneration of the human species, that every baby born into the world is a finer one than the last."
Tacitus,human,It is a weakness of your human nature to hate those whom you have wronged.
G. C. Lichtenberg,human,It is almost everywhere the case that soon after it is begotten the greater part of human wisdom is laid to rest in repositories.
Anatole France,human,"It is almost systematically to constitute a natural moral law. Nature has no principles. She furnishes us with no reason to believe that human life is to be respected. Nature, in her indifference, makes no difference between right and wrong."
David Hume,human,"It is an absurdity to believe that the Deity has human passions, and one of the lowest of human passions, a restless appetite for applause."

Freeman Dyson,human,It is characteristic of all deep human problems that they are not to be approached without some humor and some bewilderment.

Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,human,"It is in human nature to relax, when not compelled by personal advantage or disadvantage."

Charlotte Brontë,human,It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.

Denis Diderot,human,It is not human nature we should accuse but the despicable conventions that pervert it.
Bill Bryson,human,"It is not true that the English invented cricket as a way of making all other human endeavours look interesting and lively; that was merely an unintended side effect. I don't wish to denigrate a sport that is enjoyed by millions, some of them awake and facing the right way, but it is an odd game."
Carl Sagan,human,It is of interest to note that while some dolphins are reported to have learned English -- up to fifty words used in correct context -- no human being has been reported to have learned dolphinese.

Voltaire,human,It is one of the superstitions of the human mind to have imagined that virginity could be a virtue.

Raymond Chandler,human,It is pretty obvious that the debasement of the human mind caused by a constant flow of fraudulent advertising is no trivial thing. There is more than one way to conquer a country.

Charlotte Brontë,human,It is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.
Joseph Conrad,human,"It is very difficult to be wholly joyous or wholly sad on this earth. The comic, when it is human, soon takes upon itself a face of pain; and some of our grieves... have their source in weaknesses which must be recognized with smiling compassion as the common inheritance of us all."
Antonio Guterres,human,"It is, for me, clear that the world needs a United States that is engaged in security issues, in development issues, in human rights issues. The contribution of the United States for global affairs is absolutely crucial. And the cooperation with the U.N. is very important from our perspective."
Breyten Breytenbach,human,"It may be an extreme example brought about by abnormal circumstances - but the criteria of human rights kick in, surely, precisely when the conditions are extreme and the situation is abnormal."
Robert Lynd,human,"It may be that all games are silly. But then, so are human beings."
Barry Commoner,human,"It reflects a prevailing myth that production technology is no more amenable to human judgment or social interests than the laws of thermodynamics, atomic structure or biological inheritance."
Alfred Loisy,human,"It seems obvious to me that the notion of God has never been anything but a kind of ideal projection, a reflection upward of the human personality, and that theology never has been and never can be anything but a more and more purified mythology."
Barbara Ehrenreich,human,"It seems to me that there must be an ecological limit to the number of paper pushers the earth can sustain, and that human civilization will collapse when the number of, say, tax lawyers exceeds the world's total population of farmers, weavers, fisherpersons, and pediatric nurses."
Bruce Cockburn,human,"It sounds strange to say it, but you can be in a war zone and have a lot of fun. Even though war is essentially pain on all sides, human beings have the capacity to enjoy themselves. The soldiers are mostly young people, full of enthusiasm and energy, and that's an exciting thing for an old guy like me."
Albert Einstein,human,It stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man's insecurity before himself and before nature.
Eric Hoffer,human,It still holds true that man is most uniquely human when he turns obstacles into opportunities.

Aldous Huxley,human,"Jehovah, Allah, the Trinity, Jesus, Buddha, are names for a great variety of human virtues, human mystical experiences human remorses, human compensatory fantasies, human terrors, human cruelties. If all men were alike, all the world would worship the same God."
Victor Hugo,human,Jesus wept; Voltaire smiled. From that divine tear and from that human smile is derived the grace of present civilization.
Bobby Keys,human,"John Lennon, who was a good friend of mine, he had one of the best senses of humor of any human being. And Keith Richards, fantastic sense of humor. They were smart, sharp. They had their own thoughts on matters."
Rollo May,human,"Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity."
Elie Wiesel,human,"Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings."
Erich Fromm,human,"Just as love is an orientation which refers to all objects and is incompatible with the restriction to one object, so is reason a human faculty which must embrace the whole of the world with which man is confronted."
Regis McKenna,human,"Just as one year in a dog's life is equivalent to seven years in a human life, one year in the high-technology business is like seven years in any other industry."

Barbara Grizzuti Harrison,human,"Kindness and intelligence don't always deliver us from the pitfalls and traps: there are always failures of love, of will, of imagination. There is no way to take the danger out of human relationships."
James Redfield,human,"Knowing our personal mission further enhances the flow of mysterious coincidences as we are guided toward our destinies.

Francis Bacon,human,"Knowledge and human power are synonymous.,
,
"
Daniel Webster,human,Knowledge is the only fountain both of love and the principles of human liberty.

Victor Frankel,human,Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.

Andrea Dworkin,human,"Men renounce whatever they have in common with women so as to experience no commonality with women; and what is left, according to men, is one piece of flesh a few inches long, the penis. The penis is sensate; the penis is the man; the man is human; the penis signifies humanity."
Virginia Woolf,human,"Methinks the human method of expression by sound of tongue is very elementary, and ought to be substituted for some ingenious invention which should be able to give vent to at least six coherent sentences at once."

Benjamin Disraeli,human,"Moderation is the center wherein all philosophies, both human and divine, meet."
Ivan Illich,human,"Modern medicine is a negation of health. It isn't organized to serve human health, but only itself, as an institution. It makes more people sick than it heals."

Camille Paglia,human,"Most of western culture is a distortion of reality. But reality should be distorted; that is, imaginatively amended. The Buddhist acquiescence to nature is neither accurate about nature nor just to human potential."

Zig Ziglar,human,"Motivation is the fuel, necessary to keep the human engine running."

"
Edward Bulwer-Lytton,human,"No author ever drew a character consistent to human nature, but he was forced to ascribe to it many inconsistencies."

John Ruskin,human,"No human being, however great, or powerful, was ever so free as a fish."
E. M. Cioran,human,"No human beings more dangerous than those who have suffered for a belief: the great persecutors are recruited from the martyrs not quite beheaded. Far from diminishing the appetite for power, suffering exasperates it."
Elie Wiesel,human,No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior. All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them.
John Steinbeck,human,"No man really knows about other human beings. The best he can do is to suppose that they are like himself.,

Benjamin Disraeli,human,Nothing can withstand the power of the human will if it is willing to stake its very existence to the extent of its purpose.
John Berger,human,Nothing in the nature around us is evil. This needs to be repeated since one of the human ways of talking oneself into inhuman acts is to cite the supposed cruelty of nature.
Marcus Tullius Cicero,human,"Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable than fidelity. Faithfulness and truth are the most sacred excellences and endowments of the human mind."
Alexis de Tocqueville,human,"Nothing seems at first sight less important than the outward form of human actions, yet there is nothing upon which men set more store: they grow used to everything except to living in a society which has not their own manners."
Albert Einstein,human,Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet

Barry Cornwall,human,"O human beauty, what a dream art thou, that we should cast our life and hopes away on thee!"
Booker T. Washington,human,Of all forms of slavery there is none that is so harmful and degrading as that form of slavery which tempts one human being to hate another by reason of his race or color. One man cannot hold another man down in the ditch without remaining down in the ditch with him.

George Bernard Shaw,human,"Of all the damnable waste of human life that ever was invented, clerking is the worst."
Anna Garlin Spencer,human,Of all the wastes of human ignorance perhaps the most extravagant and costly to human growth has been the waste of the distinctive powers of womanhood after the child-bearing age.
Boris Pasternak,human,"Oh, how one wishes sometimes to escape from the meaningless dullness of human eloquence, from all those sublime phrases, to take refuge in nature, apparently so inarticulate, or in the wordlessness of long grinding labor, of sound sleep, of true music, or of a human understanding, rendered speechless by emotion!"
Caroline Knapp,human,"On the broad spectrum of solitude, I lean toward the extreme end: I work alone, as well as live alone, so I can pass an entire day without uttering so much as a hello to another human being. Sometimes a day's conversation consists of only five words, uttered at the local Starbucks: 'Large coffee with milk, please.'"

Salman Rushdie,human,One of the extraordinary things about human events is that the unthinkable becomes thinkable.
Charles Horton Cooley,human,"One of the great reasons for the popularity of strikes is that they give the suppressed self a sense of power. For once the human tool knows itself a man, able to stand up and speak a word or strike a blow."
Walter Bagehot,human,One of the greatest pains to human nature is the pain of a new idea.
Aldous Huxley,human,One of the many reasons for the bewildering and tragic character of human existence is the fact that social organization is at once necessary and fatal. Men are forever creating such organizations for their own convenience and forever finding themselves the victims of their home-made monsters.
Andrew Cohen,human,One of the most extraordinary things about being a spiritual teacher is the rare privilege of being able to look deeply into the very souls of many human beings at the same time.

Margaret Mead,human,One of the oldest human needs is having someone wonder where you are when you don't come home at night.

Alexander Pope,human,"One science only will one genius fit; so vast is art, so narrow human wit."
Barbara Jordan,human,"One thing is clear to me: We, as human beings, must be willing to accept people who are different from ourselves."
Edward M. Forster,human,"Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will die."
Elie Wiesel,human,"Only one enemy is worse than despair: indifference. In every area of human creativity, indifference is the enemy; indifference of evil is worse than evil, because it is also sterile."

Viktor E. Frankl,human,"Only to the extent that someone is living out this self transcendence of human existence, is he truly human or does he become his true self.

Albert Einstein,human,"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."
Emma Goldman,human,Only when human sorrows are turned into a toy with glaring colors will baby people become interested - for a while at least. The people are a very fickle baby that must have new toys every day.

Bertrand Russell,human,"Order, unity, and continuity are human inventions, just as truly as catalogues and encyclopedias."

George Bernard Shaw,human,"Our ideals, like the gods of old, are constantly demanding human sacrifices."

John F. Kennedy,human,"Our problems are man-made, therefore they may be solved by man. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings."
John F. Kennedy,human,Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. The human mind is our fundamental resource.
Ban Ki-moon,human,"Our work for human dignity is often lonely, and almost always an uphill climb. At times, our efforts are misunderstood, and we are mistaken for the enemy. There has been a clear erosion of respect for U.N. blue and our impartiality."
Thomas E. Dewey,human,Ours is an abiding faith in the cause of human freedom. We know it is God's cause.
Brad Feld,human,"Over the years, I've been involved in many business crises. I qualify this, since my crises have never involved life and death or the survival of the human race. But they are still crises."

Carl Lewis,human,"People have always thought of me as being something, but I'm just a human being like everyone else."
Vaclav Havel,human,"People who live in the post-totalitarian system know only too well that the question of whether one or several political parties are in power, and how these parties define and label themselves, is of far less importance than the question of whether or not it is possible to live like a human being."
James Baldwin,human,"People who treat other people as less than human must not be surprised when the bread they have cast on the waters comes floating back to them, poisoned."
Amartya Sen,human,"People's identities as Indians, as Asians, or as members of the human race, seemed to give way - quite suddenly - to sectarian identification with Hindu, Muslim, or Sikh communities."
Germaine Greer,human,"Perhaps catastrophe is the natural human environment, and even though we spend a good deal of energy trying to get away from it, we are programmed for survival amid catastrophe."
Andre Norton,human,"Perhaps it is because cats do not live by human patterns, do not fit themselves into prescribed behavior, that they are so united to creative people."
Bill Forsyth,human,"Perhaps naively I thought people understand what humor was, that it was invented by the human race to cope with the dark areas of life, problems and terrors."
Kate Millet,human,"Perhaps nothing is so depressing an index of the inhumanity of the male-supremacist mentality as the fact that the more genial human traits are assigned to the underclass: affection, response to sympathy, kindness, cheerfulness."
James Baldwin,human,"Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have."
James Baldwin,human,"Pessimists are the people who have no hope for themselves or for others. Pessimists are also people who think the human race is beneath their notice, that they're better than other human beings."
Carl Sagan,human,"Philosophers and scientists confidently offer up traits said to be uniquely human, and the monkeys and apes casually knock them down - toppling the pretension that humans constitute some sort of biological aristocracy among the beings on Earth."
William James,human,Philosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human pursuits.
George Bernard Shaw,human,Physically there is nothing to distinguish human society from the farm-yard except that children are more troublesome and costly than chickens and calves and that men and women are not so completely enslaved as farm stock.
Abba Eban,human,Playing the game I have learned the meaning of humility. It has given me an understanding of futility of the human effort.
Allen Ginsberg,human,Poetry is the one place where people can speak their original human mind. It is the outlet for people to say in public what is known in private.

Vera Brittain,human,Politics are usually the executive expression of human immaturity.
Emma Goldman,human,"Poor human nature, what horrible crimes have been committed in thy name!"
Angela Carter,human,"Pornographers are the enemies of women only because our contemporary ideology of pornography does not encompass the possibility of change, as if we were the slaves of history and not its makers. Pornography is a satire on human pretensions."
Camille Paglia,human,Pornography is human imagination in tense theatrical action; its violations are a protest against the violations of our freedom by nature.
Stephen Vizinczey,human,Powerful men in particular suffer from the delusion that human beings have no memories. I would go so far as to say that the distinguishing trait of powerful men is the psychotic certainty that people forget acts of infamy as easily as their parents birth
Ben Shapiro,human,"Primarily affecting low-information voters and members of the mainstream media, Obama Worship Syndrome attributes impossible capabilities to Obama's political opponents, finds excuses for every Obama failure in everyone around him and praises the president as the finest politician - nay, human being - of our time."
Angela Davis,human,"Prisons do not disappear social problems, they disappear human beings. Homelessness, unemployment, drug addiction, mental illness, and illiteracy are only a few of the problems that disappear from public view when the human beings contending with them are relegated to cages."
Martin Amis,human,Probably human cruelty is fixed and eternal. Only styles change.
Anthony de Mello,human,Problems only exist in the human mind.

Umberto Eco,human,"Religion has nothing to do with God. It's a fundamental attitude of human beings, who ask about the origins of life and what happens after death. For many, the answer is a personal god. In my opinion, it's religion that produces God, not the other way round."
Susan Sontag,human,"Religion is probably, after sex, the second oldest resource which human beings have available to them for blowing their minds."
Ludwig Feuerbach,human,"Religion is the dream of the human mind. But even in dreams we do not find ourselves in emptiness or in heaven, but on earth, in the realm of reality; we only see real things in the entrancing splendor of imagination and caprice, instead of in the simple daylight of reality and necessity."
David M. Burns,human,"Remember that fear always lurks behind perfectionism. Confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to be human can, paradoxically, make you a far happier and more productive person."
Socrates,human,"Remember, no human condition is ever permanent. Then you will not be overjoyed in good fortune nor too scornful in misfortune."
Buddy Ebsen,human,"Remember, that of all the elements that comprise a human being, the most important, the most essential, the one that will sustain, transcend, overcome and vanquish obstacles is - Spirit!"
Michael J. Gelb,human,"Research shows that you begin learning in the womb and go right on learning until the moment you pass on. Your brain has a capacity for learning that is virtually limitless, which makes every human a potential genius."
Samuel Johnson,human,"Resolve not to be poor: whatever you have, spend less. Poverty is a great enemy to human happiness; it certainly destroys liberty, and it makes some virtues impracticable, and others extremely difficult."
Bill Bradley,human,"Respect your fellow human being, treat them fairly, disagree with them honestly, enjoy their friendship, explore your thoughts about one another candidly, work together for a common goal and help one another achieve it."
Buzz Aldrin,human,"Retain the vision for space exploration. If we turn our backs on the vision again, we're going to have to live in a secondary position in human space flight for the rest of the century."
Bobby Seale,human,"Revolution is about the need to re-evolve political, economic and social justice and power back into the hands of the people, preferably through legislation and policies that make human sense. That's what revolution is about. Revolution is not about shootouts."
Abbie Hoffman,human,"Revolution is not something fixed in ideology, nor is it something fashioned to a particular decade. It is a perpetual process embedded in the human spirit."

Virginia Woolf,human,"Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame."
Bill Bryson,human,"Roads get wider and busier and less friendly to pedestrians. And all of the development based around cars, like big sprawling shopping malls. Everything seems to be designed for the benefit of the automobile and not the benefit of the human being."
Myriam Miedzian,human,Saving lives is not a top priority in the halls of power. Being compassionate and concerned about human life can cause a man to lose his job. It can cause a woman not to get the job to begin with.
John Keats,human,"Scenery is fine, bui human nature is finer."
Jacob Bronowski,human,Science has nothing to be ashamed of even in the ruins of Nagasaki. The shame is theirs who appeal to other values than the human imaginative values which science has evolved.
Helen Keller,human,Science may have found a cure for most evils; but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all- the apathy of human beings.
Gordon Sumner,human,"Security in human systems we're told will always, always last. Emotions are the sail, and blind faith is the mast. Without the breath of real freedom we're getting nowhere fast."

Bette Davis,human,Sex is God's joke on human beings.
Blake Edwards,human,Shame is an unhappy emotion invented by pietists in order to exploit the human race.
Marguerite Duras,human,"She represents the un-vowed aspiration of the male human being, his potential infidelity - and infidelity of a very special kind, which would lead him to the opposite of his wife, to the ''woman of wax'' whom he could model at will, make and unmake in any way he wished, even unto death."
Søren Kierkegaard,human,"Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, no wonder, then, that the world goes backwards, that evil spreads. This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world. The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings."
T. S. Eliot,human,"So far as we are human, what we do must be either evil or good: so far as we do evil or good, we are human: and it is better, in a paradoxical way, to do evil than to do nothing: at least we exist."
Aaron Copland,human,"So long as the human spirit thrives on this planet, music in some living form will accompany and sustain it and give it expressive meaning."
Antonin Artaud,human,"So long as we have failed to eliminate any of the causes of human despair, we do not have the right to try to eliminate those means by which man tries to cleanse himself of despair."
Bono,human,"So what we're talking about here is human rights. The right to live like a human. The right to live, period. And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality."
William Howard Taft,human,"Socialism proposes no adequate substitute for the motive of enlightened selfishness that to-day is at the basis of all human labor and effort, enterprise and new activity."
George Orwell,human,Society has always seemed to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice.
Billy Evans,human,"Some fans have a mistaken opinion of the average umpire. He is human, all reports to the contrary. Every fellow who is successful is conscientious to almost a fault."
Carl Sagan,human,Some racists still reject the plain testimony written in the DNA that all the races are not only human but nearly indistinguishable.
Bjorn Ulvaeus,human,"Some values must be universal, like human rights and the equal worth of every human being."
Paul Klee,human,Some will not recognize the truthfulness of my mirror. Let them remember that I am not here to reflect the surface... but must penetrate inside. My mirror probes down to the heart. I write words on the forehead and around the corners of the mouth. My human faces are truer than the real ones.
Bill Flores,human,"Someday, somehow, the leadership of Planned Parenthood will have to answer for their callous disregard of the sanctity of human life. In the meantime, I am relieved that the Bryan abortion facility has gone out of business."
Albert Schweitzer,human,Sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being. Each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light.
Carl Gustav Jung,human,"Sometimes, indeed, there is such a discrepancy between the genius and his human qualities that one has to ask oneself whether a little less talent might not have been better."
Virginia Woolf,human,"Somewhere, everywhere, now hidden, now apparent in what ever is written down, is the form of a human being. If we seek to know him, are we idly occupied?"
Buzz Aldrin,human,"Space architectures capable of supporting a permanent human presence on Mars are extraordinarily complex, with many different interdependent systems."
Arthur Koestler,human,Space-ships and time machines are no escape from the human condition. Let Othello subject Desdemona to a lie-detector test; his jealousy will still blind him to the evidence. Let Oedipus triumph over gravity; he won't triumph over his fate.
Alfred N. Whitehead,human,"Speech is human nature itself, with none of the artificiality of written language."
Thomas Carlyle,human,"Speech is human, silence is divine, yet also brutish and dead: therefore we must learn both arts."

Plato,human,"States are as the men, they grow out of human characters."
Tim O'Brien,human,"Storytelling is the essential human activity. The harder the situation, the more essential it is."
Ban Ki-moon,human,"Strangely, charity sometimes gets dismissed, as if it is ineffective, inappropriate or even somehow demeaning to the recipient. 'This isn't charity,' some donors take pains to claim, 'This is an investment.' Let us recognize charity for what it is at heart: a noble enterprise aimed at bettering the human condition."
Hitopadesa,human,"Subdue fate by exerting human strength to the maximum; and if, when the effort has been made and success is not achieved, no one else can be blamed."
Charles Dickens,human,"Subdue your appetites, my dears, and you've conquered human nature ."
Samuel Johnson,human,"Subordination tends greatly to human happiness. Were we all upon an equality, we should have no other enjoyment than mere animal pleasure."
Howard Whitman,human,"Success is no exclusive club. It is open to each individual who has the courage to choose his own goal and go after it. It is from this forward motion that human growth springs, and out of it comes the human essence known as character."
Mark Twain,human,Such is the human race. Often it does seem such a pity that Noah and his party did not miss the boat.
Bernard Devoto,human,"Sure the people are stupid: the human race is stupid. Sure Congress is an inefficient instrument of government. But the people are not stupid enough to abandon representative government for any other kind, including government by the guy who knows."
Baruch Spinoza,human,"Surely human affairs would be far happier if the power in men to be silent were the same as that to speak. But experience more than sufficiently teaches that men govern nothing with more difficulty than their tongues, and can moderate their desires more easily than their words."
Buckminster Fuller,human,Synergy is the only word in our language that means behavior of whole systems unpredicted by the separately observed behaviors of any of the system's separate parts or any subassembly of the system's parts. There is nothing in the chemistry of a toenail that predicts the existence of a human being.
Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,human,"Talent develops in quiet places, character in the full current of human life."
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,human,"Talent develops in tranquillity, character in the full current of human life."

Malcolm Muggeridge,human,"Television was not invented to make human beings vacuous, but is an emanation of their vacuity."
Bob Beauprez,human,"Terri's death brings to a close a very tragic, human and personal event that has left everyone with a feeling of emptiness, regardless of what side of the issue you may have been on."
Anna Lindh,human,"Terrorism can never be accepted. We must fight it together, with methods that do not compromise our respect for the rule of law and human rights, or are used as an excuse for others to do so."

Armstrong Williams,human,That is what great athletes can do: they give us a model of striving for human perfection.

Maxwell Maltz,human,The ''self-image'' is the key to human personality and human behavior. Change the self image and you change the personality and the behavior.
Iris Murdoch,human,The absolute yearning of one human body for another particular body and its indifference to substitutes is one of life's major mysteries.
Salman Rushdie,human,"The acceptance that all that is solid has melted into the air, that reality and morality are not givens but imperfect human constructs, is the point from which fiction begins."
Alfred de Vigny,human,"The acts of the human race on the world's stage have doubtless a coherent unity, but the meaning of the vast tragedy enacted will be visible only to the eye of God, until the end, which will reveal it perhaps to the last man."
George Orwell,human,"The aim of a joke is not to degrade the human being, but to remind him that he is already degraded.,
"
Daniel J. Boorstin,human,"The American experience stirred mankind from discovery to exploration. From the cautious quest for what they knew (or thought they knew) was out there, into an enthusiastic reaching to the unknown. These are two substantially different kinds of human enterprise."
Samuel Johnson,human,The applause of a single human being is of great consequence.
Robert Schumann,human,The artist vocation is to send light into the human heart.
André Malraux,human,The attempt to force human beings to despise themselves is what I call hell.
Bayard Rustin,human,"The barometer for judging the character of people, in regard human rights, is now those who consider themselves gay, homosexual, lesbian.

Henry Louis Mencken,human,"The basic fact about human existence is not that it is a tragedy, but that it is a bore. It is not so much a war as an endless standing in line."

Ben Whishaw,human,"The criminal justice system, like any system designed by human beings, clearly has its flaws."

,
,
,

,
"

Edmund Burke,human,"The first and simplest emotion which we discover in the human mind, is curiosity."
Carlo Ratti,human,"The first autonomous cars date back to the late 20th century.

Bernard Montgomery,human,The frightful casualties appalled me. The so-called good fighting generals of the war appeared to me to be those who had a complete disregard for human life.

John F. Kennedy,human,"The great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe... the lands of the rising peoples.

William Somerset Maugham,human,"The great critic must be a philosopher, for from philosophy he will learn serenity, impartiality, and the transitoriness of human things."
Carl Jung,human,The great decisions of human life usually have far more to do with the instincts and other mysterious unconscious factors than with conscious will and well-meaning reasonableness.

Voltaire,human,The history of human opinion is scarcely anything more than the history of human errors.
Woodrow Wilson,human,"The history of liberty is the history of the limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it. When we resist the concentration of power we are resisting the powers of death. Concentration of power precedes the destruction of human liberties."

Richard Condon,human,The human comedy begins with a vertical smile.
Hannah Arendt,human,"The human condition is such that pain and effort are not just symptoms which can be removed without changing life itself; they are the modes in which life itself, together with the necessity to which it is bound, makes itself felt. For mortals, the ''easy life of the gods'' would be a lifeless life."
David Herbert Lawrence,human,"The human consciousness is really homogeneous. There is no complete forgetting, even in death."

Ban Ki-moon,human,"The human family is at a critical juncture. The world is moving through a great transition. This transition is economic, as the digital revolution advances and as new powers and groups emerge."
Anais Nin,human,"The human father has to be confronted and recognized as human, as man who created a child and then, by his absence, left the child fatherless and then Godless."
Günther Grass,human,The human head is bigger than the globe. It conceives itself as containing more. It can think and rethink itself and ourselves from any desired point outside the gravitational pull of the earth. It starts by writing one thing and later reads itself as something else. The human head is monstrous.

John F. Kennedy,human,The human mind is our fundamental resource.

Anna Howard Shaw,human,"The idealists dream and the dream is told, and the practical men listen and ponder and bring back the truth and apply it to human life, and progress and growth and higher human ideals come into being and so the world moves ever on."

Ali Hoseini-Khamenei,human,The issue of human rights is one of the most fundamental human issues and also one of the most sensitive and controversial.
Caroline Knapp,human,"The kinds of roles dogs fill can be hard to come by in human relationships. We touch the dog or the pet at whim. There is a lack of self-consciousness and a fluidity to it that is absent from most human relationships. If someone acted that way to you, you'd feel claustrophobic pretty quickly. It's a boundary violation."
Victor Frankl,human,The last of the human freedoms is to choose one's attitudes.
William Faulkner,human,The last sound on the worthless earth will be two human beings trying to launch a homemade spaceship and already quarreling about where they are going next.
Ben Shapiro,human,"The Left masks its distaste for the Bible's condemnation of homosexuality in a straw man argument that Bible believers are violent bigots. They are not. Citing the Bible doesn't make you a bigot against human beings - it makes you a bigot against sin, which is a good thing."
Alfred Hitchcock,human,The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.
Carl Sagan,human,"The library connects us with the insight and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. I think the health of our civilization, the depth of our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can all be tested by how well"

Edmund Burke,human,The march of the human mind is slow.
Helen Keller,human,The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.
Northrop Frye,human,"The metaphor of the king as the shepherd of his people goes back to ancient Egypt. Perhaps the use of this particular convention is due to the fact that, being stupid, affectionate, gregarious, and easily stampeded, the societies formed by sheep are most like human ones."
Ban Ki-moon,human,"The Millennium Development Goals were a pledge to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity, and free the world from extreme poverty.

Germaine Greer,human,The most threatened group in human societies as in animal societies is the unmated male: the unmated male is more likely to wind up in prison or in an asylum or dead than his mated counterpart. He is less likely to be promoted at work and he is considered a poor credit risk.
Henry Louis Mencken,human,"The most valuable of all human possessions, next to a superior and disdainful air, is the reputation of being well-to-do."

Jean Rostand,human,The nobility of a human being is strictly independent of that of his convictions.

Ansel Adams,human,The only things in my life that compatibly exists with this grand universe are the creative works of the human spirit.
John Haggai,human,The only way God could impose peace on the world would be to robotize our wills and rob every human being of the power of choice. He has not chosen to do that. He has given every person a free will.
Pearl S. Buck,human,The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being. His heart withers if it does not answer another heart. His mind shrinks away if he hears only the echoes of his own thoughts and finds no other inspiration.
Thomas Malthus,human,"The power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race."

Breyten Breytenbach,human,The predominant yardstick of your government is not human rights but national interests.

Karl Kraus,human,"The press, that goiter of the world, swells up with the desire for conquest and bursts with the achievements which every day brings. A week has room for the boldest climax of the human drive for expansion."
Eldridge Cleaver,human,The price of hating other human beings is loving oneself less.
Arthur Middleton,human,"The priest is Christ's slave, and Christ himself took the form of a slave and became obedient to death. So the priest in serving human needs lives a Godward life, possessed by God and witnessing that only when lives are utterly possessed by God do they find their true freedom."
Nadine Gordimer,human,"The primacy of the word, basis of the human psyche, that has in our age been used for mind-bending persuasion and brain-washing pulp, disgraced by Gobbles and debased by advertising copy, remains a force for freedom that flies out between all bars."
Bayard Rustin,human,The principal factors which influenced my life are 1) nonviolent tactics; 2) constitutional means; 3) democratic procedures; 4) respect for human personality; 5) a belief that all people are one.
Noam Chomsky,human,"The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful."
Walter Lippmann,human,"The principles of the good society call for a concern with an order of being - which cannot be proved existentially to the sense organs - where it matters supremely that the human person is inviolable, that reason shall regulate the will, that truth shall prevail over error."
Betty Friedan,human,The problem that has no name (which is simply the fact that American women are kept from growing to their full human capacities) is taking a far greater toll on the physical and mental health of our country than any known disease.

Herbert Spencer,human,The Republican form of government is the highest form of government; but because of this it requires the highest type of human nature - a type nowhere at present existing.

Alexander Hamilton,human,"The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased."
Vaclav Havel,human,"The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to reflect, in human meekness and human responsibility."
Eric Hoffer,human,The savior who wants to turn men into angels is as much a hater of human nature as the totalitarian despot who wants to turn them into puppets.

Benjamin Netanyahu,human,"Well, this is an unfortunate part of the UN institution. It's the - the theater of the absurd.

Ban Kimoon,woman,Every literate woman is a victory over poverty.

Marguerite Duras,woman,"Frigidity is desire imagined by a woman who doesn't desire the man offering himself to her.

Frigidity is the non-desire for whatever is not him."
John Gray,woman,"Generally speaking, when a woman offers unsolicited advice or tries to help a man, she has no idea of how critical and unloving he may sound to him."
Brooke Burke,woman,"Going into a pregnancy is a really challenging time for a woman, because it's forever-changing, both mentally and physically."

Bruce Forsyth,woman,"I hate the term 'arm candy.' But, look, a woman's figure is a beautiful thing, and if she has shapely legs, then she should show them off, because men love to see that. Not just heterosexual men - gay men like to see a woman in her beauty and the shape of her."

Michael J. Fox,woman,I'm going to marry a Jewish woman because I like the idea of getting up Sunday morning and going to the deli.
Ben Affleck,woman,I'm not the type of guy who enjoys one-night stands. It leaves me feeling very empty and cynical. It's not even fun sexually. I need to feel something for the woman and entertain the vain hope that it may lead to a relationship.
Andrew Cohen,woman,I'm suspicious of any man or woman who approaches their own liberation with any kind of gender bias.
Baltasar Kormakur,woman,"I'm the first Icelandic director who started working on U.S. movies.

Wyndham Lewis,woman,"If you do not regard feminism with an uplifting sense of the gloriousness of woman's industrial destiny, or in the way, in short, that it is prescribed, by the rules of the political publicist, that you should, that will be interpreted by your opponents as an attack on woman."
Josh Billings,woman,"If you ever find happiness by hunting for it, you will find it as the old woman did her lost spectacles. Safe on her own nose all the time."
Margaret Thatcher,woman,"If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.,
"
Carol Gilligan,woman,"Implicitly adopting the male life as the norm, they have tried to fashion women out of a masculine cloth. It all goes back to Adam and Eve a story which shows... that if you make a woman out of man, you are bound to get into trouble."

Abigail Adams,woman,"It is really mortifying, sir, when a woman possessed of a common share of understanding considers the difference of education between the male and female sex, even in those families where education is attended to.... Nay why should your sex wish for such a disparity in those whom they one day intend for companions and associates. Pardon me, sir, if I cannot help sometimes suspecting that this neglect arises in some measure from an ungenerous jealousy of rivals near the throne."
A. N. Wilson,woman,"It is the woman - nearly always - in spite of all the advances of modern feminism, who still takes responsibility for the bulk of the chores, as well as doing her paid job. This is true even in households where men try to be unselfish and to do their share."

Arlie Russell Hochschild,woman,"Many women cut back what had to be done at home by redefining what the house, the marriage and, sometimes, what the child needs. One woman described a fairly common pattern: I do my half. I do half of his half, and the rest doesn't get done."

Camille Paglia,woman,"Men are run ragged by female sexuality all their lives. From the beginning of his life to the end, no man ever fully commands any woman. It's an illusion. Men are pussy-whipped. And they know it. That's what the strip clubs are about; not woman as victim, not woman as slave, but woman as goddess."
Camille Paglia,woman,"Men knew that if they devirginized a woman, they could end up dead within twenty-four hours. These controls have been removed."

Barbara Walters,woman,Most of us have trouble juggling. The woman who says she doesn't is someone whom I admire but have never met.
Angela Carter,woman,"Mother goddesses are just as silly a notion as father gods. If a revival of the myths of these cults gives woman emotional satisfaction, it does so at the price of obscuring the real conditions of life. This is why they were invented in the first place."
Samuel Pepys,woman,"Music and woman I cannot but give way to, whatever my business is."

Barbara Ehrenreich,woman,"No culture on earth outside of mid-century suburban America has ever deployed one woman per child without simultaneously assigning her such major productive activities as weaving, farming, gathering, temple maintenance, and tent-building.

Buchi Emecheta,man,"Being a woman writer, I would be deceiving myself if I said I write completely through the eye of a man. There's nothing bad in it, but that does not make me a feminist writer. I hate that name. The tag is from the Western world - like we are called the Third World."
Samuel Johnson,man,"Being reproached for giving to an unworthy person, Aristotle said, ''I did not give it to the man, but to humanity."

Carl Jung,man,"Caution has its place, no doubt, but we cannot refuse our support to a serious venture which challenges the whole of the personality.

 Their hands upon their hearts."

Jean Genet,man,Crimes of which a people is ashamed constitute its real history. The same is true of man.
Jean de la Bruyère,man,"Criticism is often not a science; it is a craft, requiring more good health than wit, more hard work than talent, more habit than native genius.

"
Abraham Lincoln,man,I don't think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.
Desiderius Erasmus,man,I doubt if a single individual could be found from the whole of mankind free from some form of insanity. The only difference is one of degree. A man who sees a gourd and takes it for his wife is called insane because this happens to very few people.
Bhagat Singh,man,"I emphasize that I am full of ambition and hope and of full charm of life. But I can renounce all at the time of need, and that is the real sacrifice.

George Meredith,man,I expect that Woman will be the last thing civilized by Man.

Ezra Pound,man,I guess the definition of a lunatic is a man surrounded by them.

Samuel Goldwyn,man,I hate a man who always says ''yes'' to me. When I say ''no'' I like a man who also says ''no.''

Alexander Mackenzie,man,"I have always held those political opinions which point to the universal brotherhood of man, no matter in what rank of life he may have taken his origin."

Vash Young,man,"I have always noticed that a man who gives the most for the money, gets the most business."
Benjamin Disraeli,man,"I have always thought that every woman should marry, and no man."

William Shakespeare,man,I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream.
Dwight L. Moody,man,I have had more trouble with myself than with any other man.
Nelson Mandela,man,"I have learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. A brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear."

E. F. Schumacher,man,"I have no doubt that it is possible to give a new direction to technological development, a direction that shall lead it back to the real needs of man, and that also means: to the actual size of man. Man is small, and, therefore, small is beautiful. To go for giantism is to go for self-destruction."
Edgar Allan Poe,man,"I have no faith in human perfectibility. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active -not more happy -nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago."
Abel Hermant,man,"I have no idea what the mind of a lowlife scoundrel is like, but I know what the mind of an honest man is like: it is terrifying."
Agnes Smedley,man,"I have no objection to a man being a man, however masculine that may be."
Martin Luther,man,I have no pleasure in any man who despises music. It is no invention of ours: it is a gift of God. I place it next to theology. Satan hates music: he knows how it drives the evil spirit out of us.

Babe Paley,man,"In all things preserve integrity; and the consciousness of thine own uprightness will alleviate the toil of business, soften the hardness of ill-success and disappointments, and give thee an humble confidence before God, when the ingratitude of man, or the iniquity of the times may rob thee of other rewards."

Camille Paglia,man,"In the beginning was nature. The background from which and against our ideas of God were formed, nature remains the supreme moral problem.

Adam Sandler,man,"It definitely has learning a lesson about the way you're living your life. I wouldn't compare our movie to that, but it has a structure where it's about a man who doesn't appreciate all that he has and finds out at the end that life has been great and he has to enjoy that."

Oscar Wilde,man,"It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is with words. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only thing he is fit for."

Thomas Paine,man,"It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe."
Thomas à Kempis,man,"It is no little wisdom for a man to keep himself in silence and in good peace when evil words are spoken to him, and to turn his heart to God and not to be troubled with man's judgment."
Marcus Aurelius,man,"It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live."

Gilbert K. Chesterton,man,It is not funny that anything else should fall down; only that a man should fall down. Why do we laugh? Because it is a gravely religious matter: it is the Fall of Man. Only man can be absurd: for only man can be dignified.
Archibald Macleish,man,"It is not in the world of ideas that life is lived. Life is lived for better or worse in life, and to a man in life, his life can be no more absurd than it can be the opposite of absurd, whatever that opposite may be."

Anna Julia Cooper,man,"It is not the intelligent woman v. the ignorant woman; nor the white woman v. the black, the brown, and the red, it is not even the cause of woman v. man. Nay, tis woman's strongest vindication for speaking that the world needs to hear her voice."

Henri-Frédéric Amiel,man,"It is not what he had, or even what he does which expresses the worth of a man, but what he is."
Henry Ward Beecher,man,It is not work that kills men; it is worry. Work is healthy; you can hardly put more upon a man than he can bear. Worry is the rust upon the blade. It is not the revolution which destroys the machinery but the friction. Fear secretes acids; but love and trust are sweet juices

Vance Havner,man,"It is one of the ironies of the ministry that the very man who works in God's name is often hardest put to find time for God. The parents of Jesus lost Him at church, and they were not the last ones to lose Him there."
Ralph Waldo Emerson,man,It is one of the most beautiful compensations in life that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.

George F. Will,man,"It is said that God gave us memory so we could have roses in winter. But it is also true that without memory we could not have self in any season. The more memories you have, the more you have. That is why, as Swift said, ''No wise man ever wished to be younger.''"

Seneca,man,It is true greatness to have in one the frailty of a man and the security of a god.

Arthur Schopenhauer,man,It is with trifles and when he is off guard that a man best reveals his character.
Samuel Johnson,man,"It is, indeed, at home that every man must be known by those who would make a just estimate either of his virtue or felicity; for smiles and embroidery are alike occasional, and the mind is often dressed for show in painted honor, and fictitious benevolence."
Samuel Johnson,man,"It matters not how a man dies, but how he lives. The act of dying is not of importance, it lasts so short a time."
Martin Luther King,man,"It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important."
Baruch Spinoza,man,It may easily come to pass that a vain man may become proud and imagine himself pleasing to all when he is in reality a universal nuisance.
Ayn Rand,man,"It only stands to reason that where there's sacrifice, there's someone collecting the sacrificial offerings. Where there's service, there is someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice is speaking of slaves and masters, and intends to be the master."

Beryl Bainbridge,man,It seems to me that a mutually beneficial relationship between a man and woman requires the man to be dominant. A sensible woman will allow the man to think he is the most important partner.

Ben Zobrist,man,"It was like a heavyweight fight, man. Just blow for blow, everybody playing their heart out. The Indians never gave up either, and I can't believe we're finally standing, after 108 years, finally able to hoist the trophy."
Adam Baldwin,man,It was never the fame or fortune that drove me to act. It was something I love and enjoy doing it. A lot of people identify who they are by what they do and that's not me. It's what I do but not who I am. Who I am is a parent. I'm a family man.

Blake Farenthold,man,It's said that you can tell a lot about someone by who opposes them.

Buckminster Fuller,man,One of humanity's prime drives is to understand and be understood. All other living creatures are designed for highly specialized tasks. Man seems unique as the comprehensive comprehender and co-ordinator of local universe affairs.

Samuel Butler,man,"One of the first businesses of a sensible man is to know when he is beaten, and to leave off fighting at once."

Henry Ford,man,"One of the greatest discoveries a man makes, one of his great surprises, is to find he can do what he was afraid he couldn't do."
Ralph Waldo Emerson,man,"One of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year. No man has learned anything rightly, until he knows that every day is Doomsday."

Man Ray,man,One of the satisfactions of a genius is his will-power and obstinacy.
Benjamin Haydon,man,"One of the surest evidences of an elevated taste is the power of enjoying works of impassioned terrorism, in poetry, and painting. The man who can look at impassioned subjects of terror with a feeling of exultation may be certain he has an elevated taste."
Edgar W. Howe,man,One of the surprising things in this world is the respect a worthless man has for himself.
Bob Hoskins,man,"One of the things I've realised is that I am very simple. My wife asked me once if I loved her. I said: 'Look love, I'm a simple man. I love you. End of story.' But I guess you gotta keep saying it with women. I guess she needed reassurance."
Bruce Eric Kaplan,man,"One quintessential moment in time is when you're 22, when you graduate college. And then another quintessential time is as a middle-age man. That's the convergence."

James Allen,man,"Our life is what our thoughts make it. A man will find that as he alters his thoughts toward things and other people, things and other people will alter towards him."

Bow Wow,man,"People ask for this life, but they don't really understand what comes with it.

Diana Spencer Princess of Wales,man,"People think that at the end of the day a man is the only answer. Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me."

James F. Byrnes,man,"Power intoxicates men. When a man is intoxicated by alcohol, he can recover, but when intoxicated by power, he seldom recovers."

John Keats,man,Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own works.

Eva Figes,man,"Providing for one's family as a good husband and father is a water-tight excuse for making money hand over fist. Greed may be a sin, exploitation of other people might, on the face of it, look rather nasty, but who can blame a man for ''doing the best'' for his children?"
Joey Adams,man,Psychiatrist: A man who asks you a lot of expensive questions your wife asks you for nothing.

Ben Shapiro,man,"Putin himself is a character out of fiction, an uber-macho former Soviet thug running a massive, expansionist kleptocracy. The man stages photographs riding horses barechested and hunting tigers. His enemies find themselves on the wrong end of radioactive poisoning."
Abraham Lincoln,man,"Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and loss of self control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite."
Ann Beattie,man,"Quite often my narrator or protagonist may be a man, but I'm not sure he's the more interesting character, or if the more complex character isn't the woman."

Solomon,man,Riches are a stronghold in the imagination of a rich man.
Benedict Wong,man,Ridley Scott is a cinematic master and a great man. It was a real honour working with him on 'Prometheus.'
Lord George Byron,man,"Roll on, deep and dark blue ocean, roll. Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain. Man marks the earth with ruin, but his control stops with the shore."
Anita Brookner,man,Romanticism is not just a mode; it literally eats into every life. Women will never get rid of just waiting for the right man.
Ardal O'Hanlon,man,Running is never fun. Running is something that you do when there's a man chasing you with a knife.
Jean Baudrillard,man,"Sadder than destitution, sadder than a beggar is the man who eats alone in public. Nothing more contradicts the laws of man or beast, for animals always do each other the honor of sharing or disputing each other's food."
Paul Klee,man,"Satire must not be a kind of superfluous ill will, but ill will from a higher point of view. Ridiculous man, divine God. Or else, hatred against the bogged-down vileness of average man as against the possible heights that humanity might attain."
Myriam Miedzian,man,Saving lives is not a top priority in the halls of power. Being compassionate and concerned about human life can cause a man to lose his job. It can cause a woman not to get the job to begin with.
Johann Gottfried Von Herder,man,Say oh wise man how you have come to such knowledge? Because I was never ashamed to confess my ignorance and ask others.
Eric Gill,man,"Science is analytical, descriptive, informative. Man does not live by bread alone, but by science he attempts to do so. Hence the deadliness of all that is purely scientific."
Albert Schweitzer,man,"Seek always to do some good, somewhere. Every man has to seek in his own way to realize his true worth. You must give some time to your fellow man. For remember, you don't live in a world all your own. Your brothers are here too."
Albert Ellis,man,Self-esteem is the greatest sickness known to man or woman because it's conditional.
Florence King,man,"Self-help books are making life downright unsafe. Women desperate to catch a man practice all the ploys recommended by these authors. Bump into him, trip over him, knock him down, spill something on him, scald him, but meet him."

Barry Humphries,man,"Sex is the most beautiful thing that can take place between a happily married man and his secretary.,
"
Marty Feldman,man,"Sex is two plus two making five, rather than four. Sex is the X ingredient that you can't define, and it's that X ingredient between two people that make both a man and a woman good in bed. It's all relative. There are no rules."
Brigham Young,man,"Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so."
Carl Sandburg,man,Shame is the feeling you have when you agree with the woman who loves you that you are the man she thinks you are.

H. L. Wayland,man,Show us a man who never makes a mistake and we will show you a man who never makes anything. The capacity for occasional blundering is inseparable from the capacity to bring things to pass. The only men who are past the danger of making mistakes are the men who sleep at Greenwood.
Aaron Hill,man,"Shun fear, it is the ague of the soul! a passion man created for himself - for sure that cramp of nature could not dwell in the warm realms of glory."

Benjamin Franklin,man,"So much for industry, my friends, and attention to one's own business; but to these we must add frugality if we would make our industry more certainly successful.

Edward Dahlberg,man,"So much of our lives is given over to the consideration of our imperfections that there is no time to improve our imaginary virtues. The truth is we only perfect our vices, and man is a worse creature when he dies than he was when he was born."
Marcus Tullius Cicero,man,So near is falsehood to truth that a wise man would do well not to trust himself on the narrow edge.
Boethius,man,"So nothing is ever good or bad unless you think it so, and vice versa. All luck is good luck to the man who bears it with equanimity."
John Dryden,man,"So over violent, or over civil that every man with him was God or Devil."

Oliver Wendell Holmes,man,Stupidity often saves a man from going mad.
Wallace Stevens,man,"Style is not something applied. It is something that permeates. It is of the nature of that in which it is found, whether the poem, the manner of a god, the bearing of a man. It is not a dress."
Charles Caleb Colton,man,"Subtract from the great man all that he owes to opportunity, all that he owes to chance, and all that he gained by the wisdom of his friends and the folly of his enemies, and the giant will often be seen to be a pygmy."

Woodrow Wilson,man,"Surely a man has come to himself only when he has found the best that is in him, and has satisfied his heart with the highest achievement he is fit for."
Abraham Lincoln,man,"Surely God would not have created such a being as man, with an ability to grasp the infinite, to exist only for a day! No, no, man was made for immortality."
Barbara Ehrenreich,man,"Surely there must be some way to find a husband or, for that matter, merely an escort, without sacrificing one's privacy, self-respect, and interior decorating scheme.

That's luck. That's randomness.
Ben Jonson,man,"Talking and eloquence are not the same: to speak, and to speak well, are two things. A fool may talk, but a wise man speaks."

Hosea Ballou,man,"The act of divine worship is the inestimable privilege of man, the only created being who bows in humility and adoration."
H. Ross Perot,man,The activist is not the man who says the river is dirty. The activist is the man who cleans up the river.

C. Wright Mills,man,"The aim of the college, for the individual student, is to eliminate the need in his life for the college; the task is to help him become a self-educating man."
Paul De Man,man,"The ambivalence of writing is such that it can be considered both an act and an interpretive process that follows after an act with which it cannot coincide. As such, it both affirms and denies its own nature."
Dave Thomas,man,The anger that appears to be building up between the sexes becomes more virulent with every day that passes. And far from women taking the blame... the fact is that men are invariably portrayed as the bad guys. Being a good man is like being a good Nazi.
James Thurber,man,"The animals that depend on instinct have an inherent knowledge of the laws of economics and of how to apply them; Man, with his powers of reason, has reduced economics to the level of a farce which is at once funnier and more tragic than Tobacco Road."

Seneca,man,The bravest sight in the world is to see a great man struggling against adversity.

Suzan B. Anthony,man,"The day may be approaching when the whole world will recognize woman as the equal of man.,

Henry Kissinger,man,The essence of this man [Richard M. Nixon] is loneliness.
Benjamin Haydon,man,"The explanation of the propensity of the English people to portrait painting is to be found in their relish for a Fact. Let a man do the grandest things, fight the greatest battles, or be distinguished by the most brilliant personal heroism, yet the English people would prefer his portrait to a painting of the great deed. The likeness they can judge of; his existence is a Fact. But the truth of the picture of his deeds they cannot judge of, for they have no imagination."
Albert Pike,man,The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation; but very different are the aspects which it bears to them.
Machiavelli,man,The fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous.
George Bernard Shaw,man,The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality.
John Jay Chapman,man,The fact that a man is to vote forces him to think. You may preach to a congregation by the year and not affect its thought because it is not called upon for definite action. But throw your subject into a campaign and it becomes a challenge.
Mark Twain,man,The fact that man knows right from wrong proves his intellectual superiority to the other creatures; but the fact that he can do wrong proves his moral inferiority to any creatures that cannot.

Abraham Cowley,man,"The first three men in the world were a gardener, a ploughman, and a grazier; and if any man object that the second of these was a murderer, I desire he would consider that as soon as he was so, he quitted our profession and turned builder."

J. Robert Oppenheimer,man,The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance; The wise grows it under his feet.
Franklin D. Roosevelt,man,The forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.
Leon Blum,man,The free man is he who does not fear to go to the end of his thought.
Barbara Deming,man,"The free man must be born before freedom can be won, and the brotherly man must be born before full brotherhood can be won. It will come into being only if we build it out of our very muscle and bone - by trying to act it out."
Robert Benchley,man,The free-lance writer is a man who is paid per piece or per word or perhaps.
Henry David Thoreau,man,"The generative energy, which, when we are loose, dissipates and makes us unclean, when we are continent invigorates and inspires us. Chastity is the flowering of man; and what are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various fruits which succeed it."
George Borrow,man,"The Germans are the most philosophic people in the world, and the greatest smokers: now I trace their philosophy to their smoking.

Russell Baker,man,The goal of all inanimate objects is to resist man and ultimately defeat him.
Jose Ortega Y Gasset,man,"The good is, like nature, an immense landscape in which man advances through centuries of exploration."

Anais Nin,man,"The human father has to be confronted and recognized as human, as man who created a child and then, by his absence, left the child fatherless and then Godless."

Henry Louis Mencken,man,"The idea that leisure is of value in itself is only conditionally true. The average man simply spends his leisure as a dog spends it. His recreations are all puerile, and the time supposed to benefit him really only stupefies him."
Carl Gustav Jung,man,"The images of the unconscious place a great responsibility upon a man. Failure to understand them, or a shirking of ethical responsibility, deprives him of his wholeness and imposes a painful fragmentariness on his life."
Napoleon Hill,man,The imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans created by man.
John Keats,man,"The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness."
Nelson Algren,man,"The Impossible Generalized Man today is the critic who believes in loving those unworthy of love as well as those worthy -yet believes this only insofar as no personal risk is entailed. Meaning he loves no one, worthy or no. This is what makes him impossible."
Arthur Middleton,man,"The Incarnation is the medicine of the soul, undoing the Fall and bringing man to the Tree of Life, and the office of a priest is to administer this medicine in the sacraments."

Woodrow Wilson,man,There is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight.
Robert Frost,man,There is the fear that we shan't prove worthy in the eyes of someone who knows us at least as well as we know ourselves. That is the fear of God. And there is the fear of Man - fear that men won't understand us and we shall be cut of from them.

Wallace Stevens,man,"They said, ''You have a blue guitar, you do not play things as they are. The man replied, ''Things as they are changed upon a blue guitar.''"

Eliza Cook,man,"Though language forms the preacher, 'Tis ''good works'' make the man."
Edward Dahlberg,man,"Though man is the only beast that can write, he has small reason to be proud of it. When he utters something that is wise it is nothing that the river horse does not know, and most of his creations are the result of accident."

Albert Camus,man,"To assert in any case that a man must be absolutely cut off from society because he is absolutely evil amounts to saying that society is absolutely good, and no-one in his right mind will believe this today."
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,man,"To be a man is to be responsible. It is to feel shame at the sight of what seems to be unmerited misery. It is to take pride in a victory won by one's comrades. It is to feel, when setting one's stone, that one is contributing to the building of the world."
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,man,"To be a man is, precisely, to be responsible."
W. E. B. Du Bois,man,"To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships."

John Oxenham,man,"To every man there openeth A way, and ways, and a way. And the high soul climbs the high way, And the low soul gropes the low: And in between, on the misty flats, The rest drift to and fro. But to every man there openeth A high way and a low, And every man decideth. The way his soul shall go."
E. M. Cioran,man,"To exist is equivalent to an act of faith, a protest against the truth, an interminable prayer. As soon as they consent to live, the unbeliever and the man of faith are fundamentally the same, since both have made the only decision that defines a being."
Benjamin Tucker,man,To force a man to pay for the violation of his own liberty is indeed an addition of insult to injury.

Thomas Malthus,man,"To prevent the recurrence of misery is, alas! beyond the power of man."
Benjamin Haydon,man,"To procrastinate seems inherent in man, for if you do to-day that you may enjoy to-morrow it is but deferring the enjoyment; so that to be idle or industrious, vicious or virtuous, is but with a view of procrastinating the one or the other."
Thomas Carlyle,man,"To reform a world, to reform a nation, no wise man will undertake; and all but foolish men know, that the only solid, though a far slower reformation, is what each begins and perfects on himself."

Ben Jonson,man,"To speak and to speak well, are two things. A fool may talk, but a wise man speaks."
Henry Louis Mencken,man,"To sum up: 1. The cosmos is a gigantic fly-wheel making 10, 000 revolutions a minute. 2. Man is a sick fly taking a dizzy ride on it. 3. Religion is the theory that the wheel was designed and set spinning to give him the ride."
Benjamin Jowett,man,"To teach a man how he may learn to grow independently, and for himself, is perhaps the greatest service that one man can do another."

Bayard Taylor,man,"Twas glory once to be a Roman; She makes it glory, now, to be a man."

Robert F. Kennedy,man,"Ultimately, America's answer to the intolerant man is diversity, the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired."

Carlos Saavedra Lamas,man,Unemployment is a great tragedy. The man who goes about hopelessly seeking work in order to earn bread for his children is a living reproach to civilization.
Carl Jung,man,"Unfortunately, there can be no doubt that man is, on the whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and darker it is. If an inferiority is conscious, one always has a chance to correct it. Furthermore, it is constantly in contact with other interests, so that it is continually subjected to modifications. But if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness, it never gets co"
Wallace Stevens,man,"Union of the weakest develops strength not wisdom. Can all men, together, avenge one of the leaves that have fallen in autumn? But the wise man avenges by building his city in snow."

Thomas Carlyle,man,"Virtue is, like health, the harmony of the whole man."
Henry David Thoreau,man,"Visit the Navy-Yard, and behold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such as it can make a man with its black arts - a mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and already, as one may say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniments."

A. B. Yehoshua,man,"We always knew how to honor fallen soldiers. They were killed for our sake, they went out on our mission. But how are we to mourn a random man killed in a terrorist attack while sitting in a cafe? How do you mourn a housewife who got on a bus and never returned?"
William James,man,We are all ready to be savage in some cause. The difference between a good man and a bad one is the choice of the cause.
Charles Horton Cooley,man,"We are ashamed to seem evasive in the presence of a straightforward man, cowardly in the presence of a brave one, gross in the eyes of a refined one, and so on. We always imagine, and in imagining share, the judgments of the other mind."

Jean-Jacques Rousseau,man,"We are born, so to speak, twice over; born into existence, and born into life; born a human being, and born a man."

Marcus Tullius Cicero,man,"We are motivated by a keen desire for praise, and the better a man is the more he is inspired by glory. The very philosophers themselves, even in those books which they write in contempt of glory, inscribe their names."

Joseph Roux,man,"We call that person who has lost his father, an orphan; and a widower that man who has lost his wife. But that man who has known the immense unhappiness of losing a friend, by what name do we call him? Here every language is silent and holds its peace in impotence."
Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe,man,We can always redeem the man who aspires and strives.
Oscar Wilde,man,We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.

James Truslow Adams,man,"We cannot advance without new experiments in living, but no wise man tries every day what he has proved wrong the day before."

Henry David Thoreau,man,We falsely attribute to men a determined character - putting together all their yesterdays - and averaging them - we presume we know them. Pity the man who has character to support - it is worse than a large family - he is the silent poor indeed.

John Ruskin,man,"We have seen when the earth had to be prepared for the habitation of man, a veil, as it were, of intermediate being was spread between him and its darkness, in which were joined in a subdued measure, the stability and insensibility of the earth, and the passion and perishing of mankind."

Arthur C. Clarke,man,"We have to abandon the idea that schooling is something restricted to youth. How can it be, in a world where half the things a man knows at 20 are no longer true at 40 - and half the things he knows at 40 hadn't been discovered when he was 20?"
Auberon Herbert,man,"We hold that what one man cannot morally do, a million men cannot morally do, and government, representing many millions of men, cannot do."
Bobby Keys,man,"We just get up there and play rock-and-roll music, man. Everybody sweats and has a good time."
George Steiner,man,"We know that a man can read Goethe or Rilke in the evening, that he can play Bach and Schubert, and go to his day's work at Auschwitz in the morning."
Chief Seattle,man,"We know that the white man does not understand our ways. One portion of land is the same to him as the next, for he is a stranger who comes in the night and takes from the land whatever he needs. The earth is not his brother, but his enemy, and when he has conquered it, he moves on."
Mark Twain,man,"We like a man to come right out and say what he thinks, if we agree with him."
Jose Ortega Y Gasset,man,"We live at a time when man believes himself fabulously capable of creation, but he does not know what to create."
Aaron Sorkin,man,"We live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You?... You can't handle it. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty. We use these words as a backbone to a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the "

Amy Vanderbilt,man,We must learn which ceremonies may be breached occasionally at our convenience and which ones may never be if we are to live pleasantly with our fellow man.

Aristotle,man,We praise a man who feels angry on the right grounds and against the right persons and also in the right manner at the right moment and for the right length of time.

Bill Cosby,man,"We see a successful, elegant man now, but as a child, an adolescent, his life was not a done deal. Sidney respected his mistakes. When failure came, he never said, This is too difficult, too hard, he had the resiliency to try again. His life is somewhere between astounding and unbelievable."
Henry David Thoreau,man,We shall see but little way if we require to understand what we see. How few things can a man measure with the tape of his understanding! How many greater things might he be seeing in the meanwhile!

John Wicker,man,"Wealth is not in making money, but in making the man while he is making money."
Sean O'Casey,man,"Wealth often takes away chances from men as well as poverty. There is none to tell the rich to go on striving, for a rich man makes the law that hallows and hollows his own life."
Helen Rowland,man,Wedding: the point at which a man stops toasting a woman and begins roasting her.
Betty Buckley,man,"Well, the teacher I studied with for nineteen and a half years was a man named Paul Gavert.

Jose Ortega Y Gasset,man,"Were art to redeem man, it could do so only by saving him from the seriousness of life and restoring him to an unexpected boyishness."
Edgar Allan Poe,man,"Were I called on to define, very briefly, the term Art, I should call it ''the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul.'' The mere imitation, however accurate, of what is in Nature, entitles no man to the sacred name of ''Artist.''"

Robertson Davies,man,What we call luck is the inner man externalized. We make things happen to us.
E. M. Cioran,man,"What we want is not freedom but its appearances. It is for these simulacra that man has always striven. And since freedom, as has been said, is no more than a sensation, what difference is there between being free and believing ourselves free?"
Boris Pasternak,man,"What you don't understand is that it is possible to be an atheist, it is possible not to know if God exists or why He should, and yet to believe that man does not live in a state of nature but in history, and that history as we know it now began with Christ, it was founded by Him on the Gospels."
Malcolm S. Forbes,man,"What's an expert? I read somewhere, that the more a man knows, the more he knows, he doesn't know. So I suppose one definition of an expert would be someone who doesn't admit out loud that he knows enough about a subject to know he doesn't really know how much."

Marc Chagall,man,"When I am finishing a picture I hold some God-made object up to it - a rock, a flower, the branch of a tree or my hand - as a kind of final test.

Bobby Keys,man,"When I talk about rock n' roll, to me, that goes back to the beginning of the 1950s. Blue suede shoes and sideburns, man. Pink and black coloured clothes. Turn your collar up, comb your hair in ducktails. And the music was cool. It was a whole culture then - a different world."

Napoleon Hill,man,"Before success comes in any man's life, he's sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That's exactly what the majority of men do."

Bette Davis,child,"Discipline is a symbol of caring to a child. He needs guidance. If there is love, there is no such thing as being too tough with a child. A parent must also not be afraid to hang himself. If you have never been hated by your child, you have never been a parent."
Thurgood Marshall,child,"A child born to a Black mother in a state like Mississippi has exactly the same rights as a white baby born to the wealthiest person in the United States. It's not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for."

Karl Kraus,child,"A child learns to discard his ideals, whereas a grown-up never wears out his short pants."

John F. Kennedy,child,A child miseducated is a child lost.
Bob Keeshan,child,A child needs to be listened to and talked to at 3 and 4 and 5 years of age. Parents should not wait for the sophisticated conversation of a teenager.

Bret Easton Ellis,child,"A child should never even think about being a ""good son."" A parent decides that fate for the child. The parent encourages that. Not the child himself. And the perfect dad? I shudder at thinking what that may be."

Carlos Gershenson,child,"A one-night-stander is someone who does not dare to explore the full potential of a relationship, just like a child who is afraid to go to the deep part of the pool. The latter does not want to learn how to swim, the former does not want to learn how to live."
Abdul Kalam,child,"A person with belief never grovels before anyone, whining and whimpering that it's all too much, that he lacks support, that he is being treated unfairly.

Lydia M. Child,child,A reformer is one who sets forth cheerfully toward sure defeat.
Abdoulaye Wade,child,"A small child from a developing country has the advantage, from a very early age, of having access to toys which structure his mind, which constitute a sure advantage over the little African child who has never even held a modern toy."

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,child,"A torn jacket is soon mended; but hard words bruise the heart of a child.,
"
Jane Harrison,child,"A young and vital child knows no limit to his own will, and it is the only reality to him. It is not that he wants at the outset to fight other wills, but that they simply do not exist for him. Like the artist, he goes forth to the work of creation, gloriously alone."

Bob Beauprez,child,"Barack Obama likes to point to General Motors as the poster child for the job creation success of his economic policies.

Lydia M. Child,child,"Childhood itself is scarcely more lovely than a cheerful, kindly, sunshiny old age."
John Bradshaw,child,Children are curious and are risk takers. They have lots of courage. They venture out into a world that is immense and dangerous. A child initially trusts life and the processes of life.
Bill Hicks,child,Children are smarter than any of us. Know how I know that? I don't know one child with a full time job and children.
George Eliot,child,"Children demand that their heroes should be freckleless, and easily believe them so: perhaps a first discovery to the contrary is less revolutionary shock to a passionate child than the threatened downfall of habitual beliefs which makes the world seem to totter for us in maturer life."
Brad Sherman,child,Circumcision is obligatory for Jewish-born males - it must be performed on the eighth day after birth and is only postponed in the case of threat to the life or health of the child. Muslim parents also circumcise their male children.
Alan Bennett,child,"Closing a public library is child abuse, really, because it hinders child development."
Bo Burnham,child,"Comedy doesn't really matter that much; I know that. I treat it like an adult - I don't treat it like a child or a god, which some people do. This might just be in America, but 'stand-up comedy' is something very particular that I don't particularly relate to."
Ban Ki-moon,child,"Countries with higher levels of gender equality have higher economic growth. Companies with more women on their boards have higher returns. Peace agreements that include women are more successful. Parliaments with more women take up a wider range of issues - including health, education, anti-discrimination, and child support."
Rose Macaulay,child,"Cranks live by theory, not by pure desire. They want votes, peace, nuts, liberty, and spinning-looms not because they love these things, as a child loves jam, but because they think they ought to have them. That is one element which makes the crank."
Norman Podhoretz,child,"Creativity represents a miraculous coming together of the uninhibited energy of the child with it apparent opposite and enemy, the sense of order imposed on the disciplined adult intelligence."

Richard Buckminster Fuller,child,Every child is born a genius.

Bow Wow,child,"Guys like Todd Bridges never overcame being a child star. You can't have any big failures. I've always felt regular. I played organized ball at the rec league. At 13, they told me I sold 3 million copies. I didn't know what that meant."

"
George Konrad,child,I believe that it is my job not only to write books but to have them published. A book is like a child. You have to defend the life of a child.
Abbott Eliot Kittredge,child,"I believe that the fewer the laws in a home the better; but there is one law which should be as plainly understood as the shining of the sun is visible at noonday, and that is, implicit and instantaneous obedience from the child to the parent, not only for the peace of the home, but for the highest good of the child."
Bryce Dallas Howard,child,"I can only really speak for myself and what I've noticed in my kids and the people in my life, but because dinosaurs were real, and yet they seem so fantastical, is why they held such a huge fascination for me as a child. They're so different from human beings."

James Joyce,child,I think a child should be allowed to take his father's or mother's name at will on coming of age. Paternity is a legal fiction.

Alan Bennett,child,I was an only child. I lost both my parents. By the time I was twenty I was bald. I'm homosexual.

Enid Bagnold,child,"In marriage there are no manners to keep up, and beneath the wildest accusations no real criticism. Each is familiar with that ancient child in the other who may erupt again. We are not ridiculous to ourselves. We are ageless. That is the luxury of the wedding ring."
Don Marquis,child,"In order to influence a child, one must be careful not to be that child's parent or grandparent."

Ralph Waldo Emerson,child,"Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence, then, this worship of the past?"
Campbell Brown,child,"It comes down to what your priorities are, and if public education is about kids, then every decision we make should be focused on the question of 'Is this good for a child?' And that should be the driving focus and the priority when we decide what our policies should be and what our laws should be."
Dwight L. Moody,child,It is a masterpiece of the devil to make us believe that children cannot understand religion. Would Christ have made a child the standard of faith if He had known that it was not capable of understanding His words?
George Bernard Shaw,child,It is a monstrous thing to force a child to learn Latin or Greek or mathematics on the ground that they are an indispensable gymnastic for the mental powers. It would be monstrous even if it were true.

Bill Cosby,child,Laughter brings out the child in all of us.
Alice Miller,child,"Learning is a result of listening, which in turn leads to even better listening and attentiveness to the other person. In other words, to learn from the child, we must have empathy, and empathy grows as we learn."

Beth Riesgraf,child,"My background is in dance. No, I'm kidding. I was actually really uncoordinated as a child, when it came to dance, but I did play a lot of sports, and I do some break-dancing from time-to-time. No, I really don't."
Bruno Mars,child,My father moved to Hawaii from Brooklyn and my mother came there as a child from the Philippines. They met at a show where my dad was playing percussion. My mom was a hula dancer.

Barbara Corcoran,child,"My greatest strength as a child, I realize now, was my imagination. While every other kid was reading and writing, I had seven whole hours a day to practice my imagination. When do you get that space in your life, ever?"

Barbara Ehrenreich,child,"No culture on earth outside of mid-century suburban America has ever deployed one woman per child without simultaneously assigning her such major productive activities as weaving, farming, gathering, temple maintenance, and tent-building.

Marcus Tullius Cicero,child,"Not to know what has been transacted in former times is to be always a child. If no use is made of the labors of past ages, the world must remain always in the infancy of knowledge."
Bill Cosby,child,"Nothing separates the generations more than music. By the time a child is eight or nine, he has developed a passion for his own music that is even stronger than his passions for procrastination and weird clothes."

Bernie Siegel,child,"Parents, teachers, clergy and physicians change lives with their words. It is hypnotic for a child or patient to hear an authority figure's words. As I am always sharing, 'wordswordswords' can become 'swordswordswords,' and we can kill or cure with either words or swords."
Ted Cook,child,"Parents: persons who spend half their time worrying how a child will turn out, and the rest of the time wondering when a child will turn in."

Anne Cassidy,child,Seeing to it that a youngster grows up believing not just in the here and now but also in the grand maybes of life guarantees that some small yet crucial part of him remains forever a child.
Garrison Keillor,child,"Selective ignorance, a cornerstone of child rearing. You don't put kids under surveillance: it might frighten you. Parents should sit tall in the saddle and look upon their troops with a noble and benevolent and extremely nearsighted gaze."
Emma Goldman,child,"Since every effort in our educational life seems to be directed toward making of the child a being foreign to itself, it must of necessity produce individuals foreign to one another, and in everlasting antagonism with each other."

William Wordsworth,child,The child is father of the man.
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,child,"The child is naturally meditative. He is a sort of samadhi; he's coming out of the womb of existence. His life river is yet absolutely fresh, just from the source.

And he is not separate from his knowledge; he is his knowledge. He has not mind, he has simple being."

Bell Hooks,child,"There is no life to be found in violence. Every act of violence brings us closer to death.

Cate Blanchett,character,"Things present themselves to you, and it's how you choose to deal with them that reveals who you are. We all say a lot of things, don't we, about who we are and how we think. But in the end it's your actions, how you respond to circumstance that reveals your character."
Adam Sandler,character,This character feels so much like my brother. He has two children. He has a wife. He works with me. He chooses to stay in New Hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with. He doesn't want them to lose friends. He is his family's hero.
